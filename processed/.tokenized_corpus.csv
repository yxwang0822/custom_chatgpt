This was followed by interest rate rises throughout the year, as Central Banks tackled rising inflation. Both interest rate and inflation rises have a material impact on the balance sheet of a life insurer, such as ALPI dac.

The key elements of this framework comprise risk appetite (including risk preferences and risk tolerances); risk governance, including risk policies and business standards; and the processes used to identify, measure, monitor and report risks, including the use of risk models and stress and scenario testing. To promote a consistent and rigorous approach to risk management across all parts of the business, there is a set of risk policies and business standards which set out the requirements for risk strategy, appetite, and minimum requirements for the Companyâs operations. For the purposes of risk identification and measurement, risks are usually grouped by risk type: credit, market, liquidity, underwriting and operational risk. Risks falling within these types may affect a number of metrics including those relating to balance sheet strength, liquidity and profit. They may also affect the performance of the products delivered to customers and the service to customers and distributors, which can be categorised as risks to the brand and reputation or as conduct risk. A regular top-down risk assessment and reporting process is facilitated by the Risk Management function.",489

This, together with the risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) process, are the main processes used to Identify, Measure, Manage, Monitor, Report (IMMMR) risks. They are run separately but are complementary. The RCSA process is run by the first line, with challenge by the Risk Management function. It focuses on operational risks, which are recorded on âiCAREâ, the Companyâs risk management system. Risk models are an important tool in the measurement of risks and are used to support the monitoring of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available. A range of stress tests are carried out (where one risk factor, such as interest rates, is assumed to vary) and scenario tests (where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary) to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged. The Risk Management function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge of the IMMMR process and for developing the RMF. Internal Audit provides an independent assessment of the risk framework and internal control processes. Board oversight of risk and risk management across the Company is maintained on a regular basis through the Board Risk Committee. The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take. Risk appetites are set for solvency, liquidity, climate, macro, longevity and interest rate risk. The position against appetite is monitored and reported to the Board Risk Committee on a regular basis (normally quarterly). It is recognised that it is important to have an appropriate risk culture (âtone from the topâ). An appropriate culture includes the effective management of exposures, adequate resourcing, effective communication, malpractice reporting, a business ethics code that is annually signed up to by employees, and a commitment to integrity, ethical behaviour and compliance. A risk and control goal is set for senior management as part of the annual bonus plan to help drive and reward effective risk management and a robust control environment.

It is identified using management information, experience and trend analysis, information from the Risk Management function and risk committee and any external data available. The Company holds capital in order to ensure that it can meet its obligations across a wide range of risk scenarios. The main basis used by the Company to determine the amount of capital to hold is the Solvency II Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). This determines the capital needed if a 1 in 200 year loss event occurs. The Company has adopted the Standard Formula approach to determine the capital required based on its risk profile. An assessment has been carried out by the Company to confirm that its use of the Standard Formula is appropriate. The Standard Formula provides information on stresses to each of the risk types. Additional scenario based stresses are carried out as part of the ORSA. Based on these results, the company is satisfied that the Standard Formula is appropriate. The Company notes that the vast majority of its Best Estimate Liabilities (BEL) relate to either unit-linked business or business within withprofits funds where the BEL reflects the value of the assets in the funds. Scenario and stress testing are used in addition to the SCR to determine the target level of capitalisation. The use of capital alone is not sufficient to mitigate risk.

This can happen even when a company meets all its solvency requirements. Liquidity risk is monitored regularly to ensure that the level of risk remains acceptable. We do not expect liquidity to be a key risk. C.4.2 Risk Management Investments As at 31 December 2022 the majority of the non-linked assets are invested in sovereign bonds and cash, these produce regular income to meet outgoings. These are highly liquid assets and of an appropriate duration. Adequate funds are held in cash for day to day expenses; these are reviewed regularly. Unexpected claims This can result from higher than expected claims or policy surrenders. This is mitigated by investing in high quality liquid assets that can be realised over a short period. Some policy conditions allow us to defer claim payments in the case of illiquid underlying assets. Stress testing Stress testing is carried out to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity in extreme circumstances. This will enable us to reduce the liquidity risk. Risk concentration As all of our insured risk is in Ireland, the concentration risk is that of excessive claims, which could lead to liquidity problems. Stress testing should highlight this risk.

We accept a certain amount of operational risk as part of our business model. C.5.2 Risk Management Business Continuity Plan (BCP) The Company has a BCP in place. The BCP includes an external site where the Company can relocate in the event that the office or computer systems become unusable for a period. The testing of the BCP indicates that the Company could bring its systems live at the external sites in a matter of hours. Cyber risk security measures The Company's IT department has in place an extensive range of security measures to protect the integrity of the system and the security of the data. It also engages with the business to ensure awareness of the threats that exist. This includes conducting education sessions with all staff. IT engages with external experts to benchmark its security posture against best practice. Regulatory changes Regulations are monitored by the relevant departments in the company. Any changes will be reviewed and procedures put in place to ensure that we continue to demonstrate compliance. ORSA As part of the ORSA process operational risks are assessed. In addition, stress tests are carried out which will enable us to determine the level of risk we are exposed to. This can help us to determine the best mitigation methods.

We have reinsurance in place to reduce our net exposure to potential losses. We have a high-level of quota share reinsurance in place on Individual Protection business, and for Group Life protection we have surplus reinsurance for individual claims and a lower-level of quota share reinsurance. Underwriting procedures on Individual Life Protection products limit our exposure to cohorts of the population at highest risk of Covid-19 (i.e. the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions). While we have greater potential net exposure through Group Life Protection, we are taking pricing actions to limit our potential exposure from new business.

This materially decreases our exposure. Market risk As a result of the financial market impact of Covid-19 we have taken a number of actions to reduce our exposure to equity, property, and interest rate risk across all our markets.

Level 1: The best evidence of the economic value is a quoted price in an active, deep, liquid and transparent market (mark-to-market) for identical assets or identical liabilities. If quoted prices exist for similar assets or liabilities, the value of these should be used with an adjustment to reflect the prices. Level 2: If a quoted price does not exist or the market is deemed not to be active, the Company uses a valuation technique in determining the economic value. The Company will use a valuation technique which is commonly used in the industry (best practices) and will use market observable inputs (mark-to-model). Level 2 also comprises market quotes for products with similar characteristics. Level 3: If the key inputs of the valuation technique are not observable in the market or deemed not to be reliable, the Company will use its own inputs (if meeting the data quality requirements) as basis for the variables (mark-to-model). If a model is used to value a (financial) liability, the input parameters regarding the own credit standing may not be changed after the initial assessment. Level 4: In any other case, the Company will use âexpert judgmentâ as basis for determining the economic value of assets or liabilities. When measuring the economic value, the Company will take into account any characteristic of the asset or liability including any restriction on the sale or use of the assets.",384

When considering the definitions of economic value outlined above under Solvency II, it can be concluded that these closely match the current definitions as used within the International Financial Reporting Standards.

These are contracts in which the Company assumes the insurance risk from another party - a policyholder. From the perspective of Solvency legislation an insurance contract is defined as selling business according to one of the defined lines of business by an authorised life or non-life insurer. The definition of the lines of business describes which risks are transferred from the policyholder to the insurer. The following lines of business are used: â¢ Health insurance (direct business) without options and guarantees; â¢ Insurance with profit participation; â¢ Index-linked and unit-linked life insurance without options and guarantees; â¢ Index-linked and unit-linked life insurance with options and guarantees; and â¢ Other life without options and guarantees. The Technical Provisions are the sum of a Best Estimate Liability and a Risk Margin, together with Technical Provisions calculated as a whole in the case of unit-linked business. Each of these is calculated separately and dealt with in turn below. Best Estimate Liability âBest Estimate Liabilitiesâ are the best estimate of the value of the Companyâs obligations under the policies it has written. Best Estimate Liabilities are based on the probability-weighted average of future cash-flows, taking account of the time value of money (expected present value of future cash-flows), using the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. They are presented gross on the Balance Sheet (i.e. without deduction of the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts â see below). Best Estimate Liabilities are calculated on a policy-by-policy basis. Risk Margin The âRisk Marginâ reflects the extra premium another insurer would be expected to require to take over and meet the Companyâs insurance obligations. The Risk Margin is calculated by determining the cost of providing an amount of Eligible Own Funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) necessary to support the insurance obligations over their lifetime.",481
41,aviva-life-pensions-ireland-sfcr-2022.txt,"The rate used to determine this cost is called the âCost-of-Capital rateâ. It is set at 6% in the regulations. Reinsurance Recoverables Reinsurance reduces the Companyâs exposure to risks around variables such as mortality and longevity. âReinsurance Recoverablesâ are netted off the Best Estimate Liabilities and Risk Margin. They are amounts: 1. the Company expects to recover from reinsurers based on recognised reinsurance contracts; or 2. already claimed from reinsurers based on previous or existing reinsurance contracts. The valuation of the Reinsurance Recoverable consists of the following components: â¢ Best estimate of the recoverable of the reinsurance contract; â¢ Adjustment for timing differences; and â¢ Adjustment for the expected loss due to default of the counterparty. For valuing the Reinsurance Recoverables, the Company applies a probability weighted average of the cash flows taking into consideration the probability of default and timing differences.

There are three main types of assumptions â demographic, economic and expense assumptions. Demographic assumptions include when people are likely to die, how long people are likely to live and when are they likely to surrender their policies. Economic assumptions include the discount rate, the rate of investment return and inflation. Expense assumptions include policy maintenance expenses and investment expenses. As well as assumptions, an actuarial model is also required to project future cashflows from each of the Companyâs insurance policies, including inflows such as premiums and outflows such as claims and expenses. Please refer to section D.2.4. below for further information on the model and assumptions used. Basic Risk-free interest rate term structure (RFR) One of the economic assumptions required to determine the best estimate of the insurance liabilities is the relevant risk-free interest rate (RFR) as published by EIOPA.",494
43,aviva-life-pensions-ireland-sfcr-2022.txt,"The RFR includes the currency-specific (Euro) element of the Volatility Adjustment (see below), however the country-specific element of the Volatility Adjustment for Ireland is zero. No other long-term guarantee assessment (LTGA) measures (Matching Adjustment or Transitional Measures) are used by the Company. Volatility adjustment The Volatility Adjustment (VA) is a reduction to technical provisions to reflect temporary distortions in spreads. It reduces the technical provisions by increasing the interest rate used to calculate the Best Estimate Liability. Volatility adjustments are prescribed by EIOPA on a currency and country basis. The Company uses the VA when determining the best estimate of the insurance liabilities. The use of the VA is governed by a risk management assessment. The Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) determines whether the use of the VA is appropriate and it granted application of use of the VA for the Company in November 2019. The Volatility Adjustment for the Euro at year end 2022 was determined by EIOPA as 0.19% (end of 2021 it was 0.03%).

D.2.4 Uncertainty associated with the technical provisions Valuation of the technical provisions requires the analysis of the underlying liabilities and the collection of qualitative and quantitative information. By its very nature, quantifying the level of uncertainty associated with the calculation of Technical Provisions is a difficult task. For the purposes of this report the Company have commented on this uncertainty under the following headings: Assumptions The choice of assumptions is the main source of uncertainty. As the future is uncertain, actual experience will be different to what is assumed. The assumptions are best-estimate, determined based on internal or external data collected by the Company and are consistent with information provided by the financial markets and generally available data on insurance and reinsurance risks. Assumptions are subject to second line review (refer to section B.3) and the assumptions setting process is longstanding and well established. Assumptions are reviewed quarterly to ensure they remain appropriate. The technical provisions relating to unit linked insurance contracts are mainly determined by the value of assets in the unit linked funds. This, therefore, limits the amount of uncertainty for these types of policies.",484
45,aviva-life-pensions-ireland-sfcr-2022.txt,"Model An appropriate valuation method has been selected to ensure that the nature and complexity of the insurance technical risks have been appropriately addressed. The selection of the appropriate method is based on expert judgement which has considered, among other things, the quality, quantity and reliability of the available data and analyse all important characteristics of the business.

The amount of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses and credits can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. The principles as defined by IAS 12 are applied. Deferred tax is recognised on valuation adjustments made between the financial statements and the Solvency II balance sheet. The Company assesses the recoverability of these adjustments, in conjunction with the changes in the deferred tax position. Each addition to the deferred tax due to the valuation differences is calculated as that change in valuation multiplied by the corporation tax rate in Ireland of 12.5%.",377

Therefore, the minimum level is defined as the level where the Company is capitalised at 100% SCR; â¢ The Board has expressed that the capital in the Company needs to be set at a level to ensure solvency cover exceeds the minimum level in many but not all circumstances. Every calendar year, management of the Company produces a Business Plan for a prospective 3-year period, which is discussed in meetings of the Board in the second half of the year and approved before the end of the year.

The corporate governance mechanism around the calculation of the SCR ratio and potential declarations of dividends or requests for capital injections is set out in the Capital Management Policy. The Board will periodically, at least annually, assess the adequacy of this policy and make amendments where appropriate.

During 2022 we have focused on launching these promises and educating our employees to the important behaviours that help deliver on them, like the importance of resolving customer issues on first contact,and supporting customers in moments that matter whether on the phone or through their channel of choice. There are many examples of how the EPICC Promises have been central to Customer Experience improvement, we have integrated the EPICC Promises into our induction training for the Customer Service Centre (which serves our individual customers). Where we cannot resolve a query there and then, we focus on the behaviours of telling our customers how long their query will take, setting clear expectations and keeping any promises we set with our customers. These behaviours are also included in our quality assurance process so we can monitor if they are being done and can coach individuals where they struggle to do so. We have rolled out EPICC tips for query handling across our business dealing with corporate customers with supporting collateral. Indeed, EPICC is a key agenda item in all team meetings. In addition, we have appointed EPICC champions across Operations and Customer service to continue to drive out the EPICC agenda and help improve our corporate customer experience. We continued to embed our new telephone and communications platform which has enabled more seamless integration of voice, web chat and digital channels across our different business divisions.",479

We have introduced many measures to help us improve our understanding of customers needs, these include; a portal where our employees can see our satisfaction scores in real time, enabling a more agile response to improve our customer experience, and the delivery of a new customer experience measurement platform that enables us to conduct research on our customer experience giving us greater insight that allows the development of better solutions to improve this.We use the same external research company to measure customer satisfaction every month for our corporate customers, researching key points of our corporate customer experience. In 2022, we also expanded our Voice of the Customer programme, which aims to drive better customer experience and increase satisfaction. As a result of the initiatives above, and many others, in 2022, we achieved an Insurance Division customer satisfaction benchmarked score of 86%, a score we are immensely proud of as it keeps us in the top quartile for customer satisfaction (as measured by the Leadership Factor Customer Satisfaction Index) and shows that we are maintaining our proactive customer approach even in these extremely uncertain times.

THE CANADA LIFE GROUP (U.K.) LIMITED CANADA LIFE LIMITED IRISH LIFE GROUP LIMITED IRISH LIFE ASSURANCE PLCSOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202212 We are the largest life and pensions group in Ireland, serving over 1.3 million customers. The Irish Life brand is one of the most established and recognised financial brands in Ireland. Our strong brand is thanks to our large distribution network, product innovation, flexibility and strong investment performance. We operate through two main divisions, Irish Life Retail (Retail Life) for our individual and small business customers and Irish Life Corporate Business (Corporate Life) for our corporate customers. Our market share in 2022 was circa 38% (2021: circa 34%). We provide pensions, life and investment products to individual and small business customers in Ireland. We lead the market with a comprehensive product range spanning protection, pensions, investment and regular savings products. We have the largest and most diverse distribution network of any life assurance company in Ireland, and have the largest direct sales force. We have a multi-channel distribution strategy. This means that sales are split between: > Independent brokers and independently regulated tied agents. > Tied agents in bank branches. > Our employed and self-employed sales force. The bancassurance model that we operate is undergoing a period of significant change. Ulster Bank is in the process of exiting banking operations in Ireland and accordingly the tied agency agreement between ILA and Ulster Bank ended in June 2022. Likewise, KBC is also in the process of exiting banking operations in Ireland, the tied agency agreement between ILA We prepare our financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. The information in this section about underwriting performance is provided on an IFRS basis. Underwriting performance The tables below show the premiums, claims, expenses, and change in technical provisions, combined with the investment return for each of the Solvency II lines of business.

Our total sales for individual and small business customers in 2022 of 1,820 million has decreased slightly from last year (2021: 1,888 million). We use an external company to help measure customer service every month. At the end of 2022 we achieved a score of 86% (2021: 86%). This keeps us in the top quartile of companies for customer satisfaction based on a league table of over 700 companies across all business sectors in Ireland and the U.K. We sell pensions and risk products to our corporate customers, namely employers and affinity groups in Ireland, through direct, pension consultants and brokerage channels. The key drivers of sales growth for corporate customers are: > Employment and salary growth in the Irish economy. > The move towards defined contribution pensions, away from defined benefit pensions. > The de-risking of defined benefit pension liabilities through bulk annuity and bulk personal retirement bond buyouts. Our corporate customer sales increased by 65% to 1,644 million, compared to 997 million in 2021, mainly due to a greater number of defined contribution (DC) sales and some large bulk annuity sales in 2022.",484

Investment expenses Our non-linked investment managers are Irish Life Investment Managers Limited and Canada Life Asset Management Limited, who charge an arms length fee based on assets under management. Investment performance Global bond markets were negatively impacted during the year by the dramatic shift in monetary policy in response to persistently high inflation. Eurozone inflation rose to a high of 10.6% y/y before ending the year at 10.1% y/y, still well ahead of the European Central Banks (ECB) target of 2.0%. In the US, inflation rose to a high of 9.1% y/y before declining to 7.1% y/y at year end.",493
89,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Due to this unexpectedly high inflation, interest rates were raised significantly with the US Fed raising interest rates by 4.25% while the ECB hiked rates by 2.50%. Eurozone bonds fell in 2022 as the ECB began to tighten monetary policy in a bid to tackle inflation concerns by raising interest rates for the first time in eleven years and ending asset purchases in July. Yields pushed higher as inflation surprised to the upside and investors began to discount a more rapid removal of policy accommodation by the ECB. By the end of 2022 the ECB had raised interest rates by 250bps with the deposit rate at 2.00%. In December it indicated further significant rate rises were required with the market discounting a peak deposit rate of 3.5% in 2023. It also announced it would begin reducing its balance sheet by approx. 15bn per month as it plans to begin quantitative tightening (QT) from March. The German 10-year yield was 2.57% at the end of December which was the high for the year and the highest level over the last eleven years. The low in the German 10-year yield was -0.18% in early January 2022. Peripheral bond spreads widened over the year on reduced policy accommodation from the ECB both in terms of the ending of asset purchases and the beginning of interest rate rises. In early June spreads widened to the highest levels in several years and resulted in the ECB announcing plans to lower spreads and reduce the perceived risks to the Eurozone financial system. The ECB indicated proceeds from maturing debt within its current asset holdings would be redirected towards peripheral markets. It also announced a new policy tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), which will be activated when peripheral spreads have widened beyond what are seen as justifiable levels and would involve the ECB entering the market to buy peripheral bonds. Peripheral spreads stabilised post the announcement of these measures. At year end, 10-year spreads against Germany stood at 213bps and 109bps in Italy and Spain respectively.

91,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Investment performance The backdrop for the global economy and investment markets changed significantly compared to expectations at the beginning of the year with inflation proving to be more persistent and the global economy rapidly transitioning from mid to late cycle. Inflation was front and centre for markets in 2022, being the key driver for central bank policy settings, pushing bond yields higher, undermining the relative valuation case for equities and squeezing consumer real incomes and spending power, which negatively impacted growth. Inflation proved to be higher and more persistent than expected, rising to the highest levels in over 40 years. This resulted in major policy shifts among global central banks with the most aggressive tightening of monetary policy in several decades through a combination of rising interest rates and balance sheet reduction. The outbreak of the greatest military conflict in Europe since World War 2 exacerbated inflation pressures and was a major drag on European growth. The persistence by China with a zero tolerance Covid policy led to rolling lockdowns, dented growth and further disrupted supply chains and added to inflation pressures. The various shocks which hit the global economy in 2022 caused growth to slow with increasing fears of a global recession. Business sentiment and consumer confidence fell while activity levels slowed. This resulted in global growth forecasts for 2022 being reduced from 4.2% at the start of the year to 3.0% with lower growth expected in 2023 of 2.2%. Higher inflation, weaker growth, tighter policy settings, geopolitical uncertainties and reduced visibility on the overall outlook weighed on investment markets in 2022. Global equities fell into a bear market, down over 21% at their lows while bond markets experienced one of their worst years on record as yields rose across the globe to the highest levels in almost 15 years. Equities Over the year, global equities fell 15.6% in local currency terms although were down less in euro terms, 12.6%, as the weaker euro boosted returns for euro based investors Equity markets were weak in 2022, initially falling as the US Federal Reserve became more hawkish, guiding towards a faster pace of policy tightening, both in terms of the number of interest rate rises and timing and pace of balance sheet reduction. The shift to a more hawkish policy stance among several central banks combined with a sharp and rapid rise in bond yields contributed to the drawdown in the early part of the year.",488
92,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Concerns over the potential fallout on growth and inflation following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia added to the weakness in equity markets in Q1. Equities maintained their downward trend in Q2 as inflation continued to surprise to the upside with underlying inflation pressures at the start of the year being exacerbated by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. As inflation rose to 40-year highs, central banks were forced to become more hawkish and aggressive in terms of the pace of monetary policy tightening, which in turn pushed bond yields to multi year highs. Equities were negatively impacted by the rise in yields, which undermined the relative attractiveness of the asset class while expectations for significantly higher interest rates posed risks to the global growth outlook. A series of lockdowns in China as it persisted with its zero tolerance Covid policy, ongoing fallout from the Russia/Ukraine conflict, declining business and particularly consumer confidence and signs of slowing economic momentum all contributed to growing risks and speculation over a possible recession in 2023 which added to the pressure on equity markets. Having hit year to date lows in mid-June, equities rallied through July and early August on expectations that central banks might begin to pause the tightening cycle by year end. In late August equities began to decline again as global central banks pushed back against speculation over a possible dovish policy pivot and reasserted their determination to continue to raise interest rates and maintain a tight monetary stance until they became convinced that inflation is under control and returning to their 2% targets. Equities continued to fall through September and early October as interest rates were raised further and central banks reaffirmed their commitment to tightening policy with markets falling to new lows for the year. Equities rallied from mid October through to the end of November as central banks dialled down their hawkish rhetoric and suggested the pace of rate rises would slow given evidence of a peaking of inflation and concerns over financial stability risks and the potential contagion from the aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening evident through 2022. Equities however declined in December as central banks indicated that monetary policy will remain restrictive for some time until they are convinced inflation is sustainably falling towards their 2% targets.

Irish Economy The Irish economy performed strongly in 2022 based on the flash GDP release which provisionally estimated growth of 12.2% for the year. GDP however is distorted by the multinational sector and Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) is viewed as a better measure of underlying demand in the economy. Q3 is the most recent quarter for which details of MDD growth are available and while GDP grew 2.3% q/q and 11.7% y/y in Q3, MDD grew 10.1% y/y and was down 1.1% q/q as domestic investment and government spending fell while consumption only grew a modest 0.3% q/q. The slowing in growth reflects the squeeze in real incomes from higher inflation, the impact from tighter ECB monetary policies and uncertainties and effects related to the Russia/Ukraine crisis which have been evident across all of Europe. The Irish economy however proved to be relatively resilient in 2022 with business sentiment surveys generally holding up better than the rest of the Eurozone, the trade sector remaining strong given the defensive nature of the export base and consumption growing 7.2% y/y to the end of Q3, supported by record levels of employment, strong consumer balance sheets and the still relatively high savings rate. A.3.3 Other information At the end of 2022 we did not hold investments in off balance sheet securitisation vehicles. A 4m (2021: 0m loss) pre-tax loss was recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when we revalued owner occupied property. We recognised a 0m (2021: 35m loss) pre-tax actuarial loss on our defined benefit pension scheme in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. This was primarily due to assumption changes (an increase to both the inflation and the pension increase assumptions) offset by improved asset returns and an increase in the discount rate used to value the future pension liabilities. In 2021 we recognised a 34m pre-tax settlement gain in the income statement due to an Enhanced Transfer Value (ETV) exercise in our defined benefit pension scheme. A number of deferred members of the pension scheme availed of the ETV offer and left the scheme during 2021.",501

SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202221 B.1.2 Adequacy of and review of systems of governance We are committed to best practice corporate governance. We are a high-impact rated entity under the Central Bank of Irelands risk-based framework for the supervision of regulated firms. This is known as PRISM or Probability Risk and Impact System. We must comply with the Central Banks Corporate Governance Requirements for Insurance Undertakings 2015 (the Requirements). These include requirements in relation to the composition of the Board and its Committees. We also submit a compliance statement to the Central Bank each year.,496
99,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"We review our systems of governance each year. We also annually review the performance of the governance committees listed in section B.1.1 (Governance structure). This includes assessing their responsibilities and updating charters if appropriate. We commission independent reviews of governance periodically, and there is an independent evaluation of the overall performance of the Board and individual directors every three years. B.1.3 Remuneration practices Our Remuneration Policy is designed to attract, retain and reward qualified and experienced employees who will contribute to our success. We use our Remuneration Policy to: > Help generate long-term value for shareholders and customers. > Motivate employees to meet annual corporate, divisional and individual performance goals. > Encourage employees to achieve goals in line with our Code of Conduct. > Align with sound risk management practices and regulatory requirements. We support the Remuneration Policy with our performance management process. This helps to develop a risk-aware performance culture that reflects our Vision and Values. The process is based on three core principles: > Quality feedback and open conversations. > Shared responsibility for the process. > Treating staff fairly and recognising their positive contribution. The umbrella policy for operational risk and the Great- West Lifeco Code of Conduct set out the principles behind our approach to managing the risks associated with our Remuneration Policy. The principles state that remuneration programmes should: > Promote sound and effective risk management and align with the risk strategy and preferences approved by the Board. > Be consistent with business and risk strategy and shareholders long-term interests. > Be consistent with the companies approach to the integration of sustainability risks in the investment decision making and investment advice process. > Be communicated to all staff. > Be competitive and fair. > Attract, reward and motivate staff to deliver on objectives and achieve success. > Be underpinned by clear, effective and transparent remuneration governance. The Remuneration Policy is also designed to meet our regulatory requirements. We identified and assessed the applicable Solvency II principles around remuneration. Then we set up and documented the following compliance arrangements: > Establishing a Board Remuneration Committee to help the Board carry out its remuneration-related roles and responsibilities; the Remuneration Committee, based on data provided, makes sure we comply with the Remuneration Policy each year. > Making sure there are specific remuneration arrangements (programmes) for the Board, senior leaders and the key control functions.",498

B.1.3.1 Share options, shares or variable components of remuneration All remuneration packages consist of: > A base salary. > Annual incentive bonus. > Retirement benefits. > Benefits during employment. Senior positions may also include a long-term incentive. The proportion of each element in the overall package will vary based on the role. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202222 The base salary reflects the skills, competencies, experience and performance level of the individual. Base salaries are based on market rate for the role as defined by independent salary surveys. We also have an annual incentive bonus scheme that links an individuals overall remuneration to the performance of the company and the performance of the individual. The bonus depends on key business units meeting objectives that are high impact and closely aligned to our critical priorities. However, this does not apply to those in senior oversight roles. Their bonuses are not significantly linked to company performance. In addition, we have a number of incentive schemes linked to the level of the role (each level attracts different payments for hitting specific targets, and has its own maximum bonus) and, where appropriate, the type of role (for example sales and investment roles). Each staff member has a number of operational and bonus objectives for the year, including an accountability heading of Risk and Management Control. We make our base salaries high enough to prevent employees being overly dependent on their bonuses. Long Term Incentives are made up of stock options, issued by our parent company, and performance share units. B.1.3.2 Supplementary pension or early retirement schemes for the members of the management body and other key functions Our Remuneration Policy does not include any supplementary pension or early retirement schemes for Board members or other key function holders. We offer enhanced early retirement pensions to all members of our Irish Life Group defined benefit scheme who are aged over 60 and have completed 40 years service.",463

Members have retained the benefits they have accrued up to the date of closure of the scheme and these benefits are still linked to final salary. B.1.3.3 Material transactions during the reporting period There were no material transactions with senior ILA managers in the period, apart from transactions linked to their remuneration and transactions relating to insurance policies conducted on normal commercial terms. B.1.4 Key functions In line with the European Regulators Guidelines on System of Governance, (EIOPA-BoS-14/253), we consider key functions to be Risk Management, Compliance, Actuarial and Internal Audit. We also view Finance as a key function. Collectively, we refer to these five functions as control functions. Control functions help the Board to manage ILA effectively. Each one reports to either the Board Audit or Risk Committee. The Board Committee approves the mandate, resources and plans for the control functions annually. The control functions report to each meeting of the Board Committees and the head of each control function has a direct line of communication with the relevant committee Chair. Each control function is staffed by professionals with appropriate skills and experience, plus a deep knowledge of our business.

The Finance Function supports the CFO in operational and day-to-day management. The Finance Function consists of two divisional finance teams and a central Group Financial control (GF) team. The divisional finance teams are our first line of defence in the finance function. They manage the financial control and reporting needs of their business lines, giving the GF team defined data through a centrally controlled general ledger and reporting platform. GF, led by the Group Financial Controller, provides finance activities through a shared service model to the company. The GF team are our second line of defence in the Finance Function. They review and oversee this data before adopting it for financial and regulatory reporting and performance management.

106,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"There is a job profile for all such roles. Typically, the job profile sets out the accountabilities for the job, the level of knowledge, skills and experience needed to do it, and the essential behavioural competencies. We have documented HR processes for recruiting into roles that must meet fitness and probity requirements. If we become aware of any concerns about fitness and probity of someone in a role subject to the Fit and Proper Policy, we will investigate and take appropriate action as outlined in the Employee Relations Escalation Process. We also have a Fit and Proper Policy which the ILA Board reviews and approves annually. The Fit and Proper Policy sets out the process for the fit and proper assessments that determine a persons fitness, probity and financial soundness. Before we appoint anyone who effectively runs ILA or has another key function, we carry out due diligence to make sure that person is fit and proper for the role. The due diligence checks for assessing whether a person is fit and proper and is financially sound are set out in the Policy. These checks align to the Central Bank of Irelands Guidance on Fitness and Probity Standards as follows: > Evidence of compliance with Minimum Competency Code (where applicable). > Evidence of professional qualifications where relevant. > Evidence of Continued Professional Development (CPD) where relevant. > Record of interview and application. > Reference checks. > Record of previous experience. > Record of experience gained outside of Ireland. > Confirmation of directorships held. > Record of other employments. The due diligence around probity and financial soundness checks takes the form of self-certification. We ask potential employees and directors to complete a questionnaire on their probity and financial soundness. We then carry out independent directorship, judgements, negative news and regulatory sanction searches. Most of the applicable roles are Pre-Approval Controlled Functions (PCFs) as defined in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 (sections 20 and 22) Regulations. In addition to our internal due diligence, before making appointments into these functions, they are pre-approved by the Central Bank. All those in a fit and proper role must reconfirm their adherence to the Fit and Proper standards and requirements every year. For those in PCF roles we carry out independent checks to validate the individuals responses.

B.2 FIT AND PROPER REQUIREMENTS The Board manages all risks across the organisation, and has put in place a comprehensive risk management framework. The framework includes a documented Enterprise Risk Management Policy. This establishes responsibilities for all key components of the risk management system, including the Board and Executive Risk Committees (see section B.1.1 (Governance Structure)). It also details the three lines of defence model we use, and establishes responsibilities and requirements for the first, second and third lines of defence. The Board has also generated a Risk Appetite Statement and Risk Strategy document, which outline our appetite for each type of risk and our strategy for accepting, managing and mitigating risks. A further suite of risk policies details the management strategies, objectives, processes, and reporting procedures and requirements for all of the risks we accept. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) has primary responsibility for implementing the risk management system. The Risk Function, under the leadership of the CRO, has created processes to make sure we comply with risk policies. It confirms this compliance each year to the Board Risk Committee as part of the annual review of all risk policies. The Risk Function also monitors and reports on all risks. This includes reporting risk exposures and compliance with risk limits to the Board and executive risk committees every quarter. There are more details of the key components of the risk management framework below. You can find greater detail on our risk profile and risk management strategies, objectives, processes and reporting procedures in section C (Risk Profile). B.3 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INCLUDING THE OWN RISK AND   SOLVENCY ASSESSMENT SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202226 B.3.1 Enterprise Risk Management framework Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework makes sure we can identify and manage all of our material risks, and that we can implement business strategy across the company while fully understanding the risks involved. There are three broad ways in which each risk type can be treated: capitalisation (hold capital in respect of the risk), management and mitigation. We review the characteristics of each risk so we can identify the appropriate treatment. These reviews weigh up the: > Current and prospective size and complexity of each risk. > Potential impact of the risk. > Transferability of the risk. > Market standard treatment of the risk.",487
108,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"The Irish Life Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Strategy documents set out our overall strategy for each type and level of risk we will assume. Our risk appetite may change as our resources and strategic objectives evolve. We embed the risk appetite and tolerance for specific risks in the business through risk policies. These set out operational procedures, controls and limit structures that establish a risk management framework for each risk type. Together, our risk policies comprise our Risk Policy Framework. B.3.2 Risk management model - three lines of defence Risk taking is fundamental to a financial institutions business profile. Prudent risk management, limitation and mitigation are therefore integral to our governance structure. We operate the three lines of defence risk model shown in the diagram below. Board of Directors FIRST LINE Primary risk-taking and management responsibility and accountability Investment and business divisions SECOND LINE Independent oversight of risk taking Control functions Risk, Compliance and Actuarial; supported by Finance THIRD LINE Independent validation Internal Audit The first line of defence This is the business divisions and our investment managers. As the ultimate owners of the risk, they are primarily responsible for day- to-day ERM operations within the established ERM Framework. They identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risk. Business divisions are accountable for the risks they assume in their operations from inception throughout the risk lifecycle. They must make sure their business strategies align with the ERM Policy including the Risk Appetite Framework. First-line responsibilities include: > Diversifying products and services, customers and distribution channels. > Developing prudent investment underwriting processes and diversifying by asset type, issuer, sector and geography. > Following a disciplined application of pricing standards and underwriting, and conducting extensive testing of the risks involved in new products and offerings. > Thoroughly managing the business by regularly reviewing, assessing and implementing relevant changes. > Conducting business to safeguard our reputation through delivering fair customer outcomes by maintaining high standards of integrity based on our Code of Conduct and sound sales and marketing practices. > Generating returns for shareholders through profitable and growing operations, whilst maintaining a strong capital position and accepting appropriate levels of risk in accordance with our risk appetite. The second line of defence This is the oversight functions - including the Risk, Compliance, Actuarial and Finance Functions. The Risk Function oversees the ERM framework, using it to challenge the compliance of the first line of defence with it. The Functions specific responsibilities and accountabilities include independently reviewing risk identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting.",499
109,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"The Risk Function looks at the work of the Actuarial, Compliance and Finance Functions when assessing compliance with the ERM Framework. It makes sure there are no conflicts of interest and reinforces independence and objectivity. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202227 The third line of defence This is Internal Audit. It carries out independent risk-based assessments of the internal risk control framework and the oversight provided by the second line of defence. Internal Audit independently assures and validates the operational effectiveness and design of the ERM Framework. This includes periodic audits of first- and second-line control processes to help promote effective and efficient operations, integrity of financial reporting, appropriate information technology processes and compliance with law, regulations and internal policies. B.3.3 Risk appetite and strategy We employ a prudent approach to taking and managing risks, with emphasis on the resilience of business operations and sustainable growth. We recognise that negative externalities, such as environmental degradation, social risk issues and climate change, may impact the long-term sustainability of the business. We also recognise an expectation of customers that the firm will act in a responsible and sustainable manner. We aim to align business goals with our corporate social responsibility strategy, and other green objectives. The Board approved Risk Appetite Statement and Risk Strategy document sets out our appetite for each type of risk, our rationale for accepting risks, and our strategy for the type and level of risk we will assume. Our risk appetite will change as our resources and strategic objectives evolve. The key objectives in the Risk Appetite Statement are below. > Treating our customers fairly and maintaining the Companys reputation: we seek to maintain a high standing and positive reputation with all stakeholders including customers, counterparties, creditors and other stakeholders. This includes building and maintaining trust, delivering fair customer outcomes, full consideration of corporate social responsibility, and effective management of sustainability and reputational risks. Meeting customer needs and expectations is a core principle in the design, distribution and administration of our products and services. > Strong capital position: we maintain a strong balance sheet and do not take risks that would jeopardise our solvency. > Strong liquidity: we maintain a high quality, diversified investment portfolio with enough liquidity to meet our policyholder and financing obligations under normal and stressed conditions. > Mitigated earnings volatility: we aim to avoid substantial earnings volatility by managing risk concentration, limiting exposure to more volatile lines of business and diversifying our exposure to risk.",489
110,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"These objectives support both shareholder and policyholder interests since both are best served if we continue to be financially strong and profitable. Equally, we can only remain profitable if customers, financial advisors and other interested parties are satisfied that we are a secure company. Risk appetite statements establish the core risk strategy across the business. We develop these statements through an iterative reviewing, monitoring and updating process that involves our key functions. The Board then approves these statements. Our strategic and business plans are aligned with the risk parameters within the risk appetite statement. We achieve our Risk Strategy goals by embedding a risk awareness culture across all our business activities, and being prudent when taking and managing risks. We focus on: > Diversifying products and services, customers and distribution channels. > Prudent investment management and diversifying by asset type, issuer, sector and geography. > Disciplined application of pricing standards and underwriting, and extensively testing the risks involved in new products and offerings. > Thoroughly managing the business through regular reviews. > Safeguarding our reputation and deliver fair customer outcomes through maintaining high standards of integrity based on the employee Code of Conduct, and sound sales and marketing practices. > Increasing returns to shareholders through profitable and growing operations, while maintaining a strong financial position. The Irish Life Risk Appetite Framework sets out limits and thresholds for risks. The Risk Function then monitors these risks and reports on them each quarter to the executive and Board Risk Committee. The Board sets risk policies that stipulate the type and level of risk the company is allowed to take on, along with the related risk management and reporting procedures. We establish risk processes and controls for each business division to enforce the specific risk policies approved by the Board. B.3.4 Risk management processes: identification, assessment and treatment The Risk Function oversees the identification of both existing and emerging risks within the company. Risks are identified from the bottom up as well as the top down. Our business divisions, senior managers, risk specialists and specific risk committees all have significant input to this. We also use our stress-testing framework, which draws on scenario analysis to spot emerging and previously unidentified risks. We use individual risk assessment frameworks at the divisional level, overlaid with our risk materiality framework, to assess identified risks. Senior managers across the company ratify any risks considered material. The Board Risk Committee then monitors these regularly. Our risk materiality framework follows the iterative approach in the chart below.",488
111,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202228 We have three different treatments for the risks we identify, and combine these treatments as appropriate. These treatments are the basis of our risk policies. 1. We may hold capital so we remain solvent if the risk impact becomes severe. 2. We may manage the risk through controls. 3. We may mitigate the risk by choosing not to take it on or transferring it to a third party. Every year we evaluate the way we categorise risk as part of our Risk Appetite Framework review. We also run an emerging-risk identification process. This involves the risk teams in the operating divisions, divisional Operational Risk Steering Committees, central risk teams, senior executives and the Board. B.3.5 Risk management processes: monitoring, measurement and reporting We monitor risk appetite limits, risk policy limits and key risk indicators (KRIs) against selected measures of risk. We measure our exposure to risk in a variety of different ways, including monitoring sums assured, nominal or market value of exposures, the level of actual deviation from expected outcomes and the range of potential deviations from expected outcomes. Our risk limits and KRIs framework is multi-layered to make monitoring, evaluating and limiting risk-taking more effective. We monitor and review exposures regularly, and report to Board and Executive Risk Committees each quarter or more often if required. The framework includes: > Limits linked to individual risks. > Aggregate risk exposures for different risk categories, measured by how much they contribute to the capital we need. The table below summarises how we measure different risks. In addition, we use our annual ORSA process to analyse the impact of different risks on company solvency under stress scenarios.",344

Morbidity risk We measure morbidity risk using the sum assured, both gross and net of reinsurance. Expense risk We measure expense risk using actual, budgeted and projected expense levels. Lapse risk We measure and monitor lapse risk by considering the number of policyholders who surrender their policies early compared to the number we expected to do so. Credit risk - fixed interest/ cash assetsWe measure credit risk by referring to the value of the assets we have invested with different counterparties. Our risk policy limits depend on the financial strength of counterparties. Credit risk - reinsurance counterpartiesWe measure our exposure to reinsurance counterparties both gross and net of mitigations such as any collateral we hold. We set a minimum rating for the financial strength of counterparties, depending on the type of reinsurance were looking for. Equity/property risk We measure market risks, such as equity/property risk, by referring to the most recent market/fund value of investments, and the value of the management charges we collect from unit-linked funds that invest in equity and property assets. Interest rate risk We measure interest rate risk by analysing how the values of our assets and liabilities change when interest rates move. Liquidity risk We measure liquidity risk by comparing the quantity of our cash and assets we can readily convert into cash to the potential demand we might face for cash.",490
113,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Currency risk We measure currency risk by analysing how the values of our assets and liabilities change when exchange rates move. Operational risk We measure operational risk, including information technology risk, retrospectively by analysing operational risk losses and near misses; and prospectively by monitoring relevant Key Risk Indicators. Strategic risk We do not measure strategic risk directly. Instead, we evaluate the existing and proposed key strategic initiatives that have been approved by the Board. Legal and regulatory risk We analyse legal and regulatory risks as part of our compliance framework, and mainly measure them qualitatively through risk reporting. Customer advice risk Customer advice is a core process that contributes to operational risk, and as such we monitor and measure it in the same way we do for all other aspects of operational risk as set out above. We also report on consumer protection and conduct risk using our compliance framework.SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202230 B.3.6 Investments Prudent Person Principle Our Board approved Investment Policy sets out the criteria we use when we invest our assets. The Policy makes sure that our approach to investment management follows the Prudent Person Principle defined in Solvency II regulations. The Policy covers the investment of all our assets, including unit-linked assets. The controls and processes set out in the policy make sure we invest in assets and instruments only when we can properly identify, measure, monitor, manage, control and report on their associated risks; and only when we can take these risks into account when we assess our solvency needs. The investment restrictions and requirements in the policy ensure the security, quality, liquidity and profitability of the investment portfolio, and that the assets are available when we need them. The value of our liabilities change due to changing market conditions - for example when interest rates change or equity prices move. We invest in assets whose values move in a similar way to the liabilities. Our Investment Policy also establishes principles and controls to manage potential conflicts of interest. Other controls in the Policy include: > Using derivative instruments only if they help reduce risks or improve portfolio management. > Limiting the amount of assets we can hold which are not publicly traded - apart from property assets, we have minimal exposure to such assets. > Diversifying our assets through strategic asset allocation limits, specified by asset type and individual counterparty exposure limits. > Placing strict rules around who we can lend assets to, and what security we need them to provide, whenever we lend assets to other investors in order to increase returns.",500

Equity Investment Strategy We offer a very broad range of unit-linked funds to our customers. These funds invest in a range of asset types, including a significant portion in equities. The investment returns for each fund accrue to our customers who have chosen to invest in the fund. Our range of funds are categorised by how volatile future investment returns are expected to be. Funds with higher levels of expected volatility are categorised as higher risk and only recommended to customers with a high risk appetite. Whilst being more volatile, these funds also have a higher level of expected returns based on how different asset types have performed in the past. Our higher volatility funds will often invest a large portion of their assets in equities. We recommend less volatile funds, with a lower portion of assets in equities, for customers who have a lower risk appetite. We also manage two with-profits funds, which are no longer available to new customers. Similar to our unit-linked funds, the investment returns on these funds accrue to the customers who are currently invested in the funds. These funds hold a portion of their assets in equities and this allocation is kept under active review. One of the factors we consider is the term to go until maturity of the policies in the fund. We do not have any other material direct equity investments. Our Asset Managers We have appointed Irish Life Investment Managers Ltd. (ILIM) and Setanta Asset Management Ltd. (Setanta) to manage the large majority of our unit-linked and with-profits funds. ILIM and Setanta are related companies within the same group as ILA. We also offer our customers access, at their discretion, to a range of funds managed by external asset managers. Our asset managers have a range of criteria they use to make investment decisions. This includes how they engage with investee companies and factors taken into consideration when assessing investee companies including Environmental, Social and Governance factors. In the case of our group asset managers (ILIM and Setanta) we have regular engagement to ensure their investment approach continues to meet our needs. We set a mandate for our group asset managers that outlines how each fund should be managed. This outlines the portion of assets that should be invested in equities and other asset types and what types of equities or other assets can be held by each fund.",496
115,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"The mandate aligns with our customers expectations for each fund. We assess the performance of the asset managers against this mandate. We monitor the performance of our funds against funds offered by other firms, which have a similar risk level. Performance is assessed net of all investment costs including transaction costs. We consider the performance over a range of time horizons. Our arrangements with asset managers are open ended, but can be terminated subject to a notice period. B.3.7 Credit assessments We do not rely solely on external credit assessments when we assess the credit quality of counterparties. We decide on the credit ratings for all fixed interest investments we take on - including bonds, cash and commercial mortgages, and investments - through an internal credit review by the appointed investment manager. We supplement this with any ratings available from external credit rating agencies. We make sure the internal rating is not higher than the highest published rating from a major external credit rating agency. We refer to the regulatory guidelines for performing credit assessments and our Risk Function oversees the process. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202231 The processes reflect the significance of the counterparty. We complete the rating process in advance of any investment with a new counterparty, and review it at least once each year. Our Risk Function monitors the credit quality of the investment portfolio, along with our compliance with our investment limits, and reports these to the Executive Risk Management Committee and the Board Risk Committee each quarter. The Risk Function also monitors and reports the credit quality of reinsurance counterparties to these committees each quarter. B.3.8 ORSA We see the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process as key to our risk management system. The ORSA evaluates our risk profile and solvency position in relation to business operations, strategy and plan. Own: Reflects our business model and corporate structure and is integrated with business plans and strategy. Risk: Evaluates risks, including emerging risks, relative to appetite, and outlines our risk management techniques and risk governance structures. Solvency: Reviews potential solvency needs under normal and stress conditions and evaluates capital and liquidity available compared to requirements. Assessment: Assesses current and projected risk position and solvency needs. The ORSA is a year-round collection of processes, integrating our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework with capital management and business planning. The ILA Board has put in place an ORSA Policy that sets out the roles and responsibilities for completing the ORSA.",499
116,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"A regular ORSA is carried out each year. A non-regular ORSA may be performed following the occurrence of a material event at an interim date between annual ORSA reports or following a significant change in the Companys risk profile or appetite. The Board, with significant support from the Board Risk Committee, owns and directs the ORSA, and reviews and approves the ORSA Policy annually. The CRO conducts the ORSA process, producing the ORSA report and maintaining the ORSA record. The Board and Board Risk Committee steer this process, and review and approve the key aspects of the process at various points throughout the year. The annual ORSA process culminates in the ORSA report, which the Board reviews and approves. The Actuarial Function helps the Risk Function to produce various aspects of the ORSA - capital projections and stress testing in particular. The Head of Actuarial Function also gives an Opinion on the ORSA to the Board. The ORSA is the main link between the risk management system and capital management activities. We have listed the key steps in the ORSA process below. They include an assessment of our solvency capital requirements in light of our risk exposures. We carry out this assessment using the Standard Formula under Solvency II to evaluate our capital requirements, and by developing our own view of the appropriate level of capital. As part of this exercise we consider all the risks we are exposed to over the life-time of the insurance obligations, whether or not these risks are included in the Standard Formula calculation of capital requirements. A key output from the ORSA is an assessment of the level of capital we need to hold, which stems from our current and prospective risk profile. We evaluate planned business strategies and proposed capital management activities as part of the ORSA process, capturing and reporting on their impact on the ORSA. The annual ORSA report projects our solvency resources for the following five years, under a base case and range of stress scenarios. The base case scenario reflects the approved business strategy and plans, updated to reflect changes to the operating environment and with certain adjustments where appropriate for the purpose of the ORSA. We also look at how material developments to the strategy or to the capital position outside of the annual cycle would affect the ORSA. Key steps in the ORSA process > Consider the business strategy The first-line business divisions present the business strategy to the Board to be challenged and approved.",489

The base assumptions are consistent with the Board-approved business plans, but with adjustments where appropriate to reflect developments since the plans were approved. The report notes any material changes in the companys risk profile since the previous ORSA and analyses the projected changes in the companys risk profile in the future. The Board reviews and challenges the report. We submit the final report, once approved by the Board, to the Central Bank of Ireland. > Review the level of capital held After considering the insights on our risk profile gained from each of the key steps above, along with other relevant matters, the Board reviews what level of capital we should hold.",485

The Risk Function analyses the impact of these on the ORSA and present their findings to the Board for consideration. > Reviewing risk policies The Board reviews and approves all risk policies each year. We update our risk policies to reflect the outcome from the ORSA process. B.4.1 Internal control framework We maintain an internal control framework, a set of processes created by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, which gives reasonable assurance that the following objectives will be achieved: > Effective and efficient operations. > Reliable financial and management reporting. > Compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls are key to managing significant risks to fulfilling our business objectives.

We must comply with this regulation because we are a subsidiary of a Canadian company. Internal Audit, on behalf of management, tests the design and effectiveness of the key ICOFR controls to make sure we meet the requirements. Each year we review the relevance of these key controls and edit them accordingly, so they continue to reflect the existing control environment. The CFO must review and approve the Internal Controls and Financial Management Policy before it goes forward for Board approval.

Our risk profile reflects our main business activities, particularly those activities that are to do with creating and selling life insurance products and unit-linked investment and saving products. We control the way we accept risks, using our expertise to manage them and create shareholder value from them. The ILA Board approves our risk appetite at least once a year. We outline the main points about our risk profile and management strategy below. Risk Appetite The ILA Board sets our risk appetite, defining a risk preference level for all significant risks. The risk preferences range from no appetite to readily accepts . We have the highest appetite for risks related to core business activities, particularly those related to insurance products and unit-linked investment management services. Risk Strategy: Solvency and Capital The main objective of our risk strategy is to keep our commitments while growing shareholder value. This risk strategy involves generating returns to sustainably grow shareholder value through profitable and growing operations, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and taking a conservative approach to risk management.",474
121,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Risk Strategy: Capital Usage and Growth We aim to maximise how efficiently we use capital and how well we control the risk to this capital. We achieve this through product design and setting target returns on the capital we invest. We believe that controlled organic growth is essential to our continued profitability. Risk Strategy: Funding We aim to self-finance our sales plan and the payment of equity dividends. We do not currently plan to raise any new sources of capital. Risk Exposures In this section we describe our main risk exposures and how we assess and mitigate them. The table below shows our Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) split by risk type. This is the capital needed to cover the 1 in 200 year adverse outcome, as set out in the Solvency II regulations. This capital can therefore be viewed as a measure of the total risk exposure to each risk type, net of risk mitigations. m End 2022 End 2021 Market risk 589 795 Life Underwriting risk 665 692 Health Underwriting risk 179 228 Counterparty risk 55 42 Requirement before diversification1,488 1,756 Post diversification 1,083 1,284 Operational risk 87 64 Loss absorbing capacity of deferred tax(146) (168) Total SCR 1,024 1,179 Note : There are some technical differences in how we view the split of the total SCR by risk category, as shown in the table above, from the presentation in Appendix 6 that follows a methodology prescribed by the regulatory authorities. The market risk SCR mainly relates to interest, equity, currency and property risks (see section C.2 (Market Risk) for more details) and credit risk (see section C.3 (Credit Risk) for more details). The life and health underwriting risk SCR relates to lapse, expense, mortality, morbidity and longevity risks (see section C.1 (Underwriting Risk) for more details).SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202236 Insurance (underwriting) risk is linked to contractual promises and obligations made under insurance contracts. Exposure to this risk results from adverse events that occur under specified perils and conditions covered by the terms of an insurance policy. Insurance risk includes uncertainties around: > The ultimate amount of net cash-flows (premiums, commissions, claims, pay-outs and related settlement expenses).",487
122,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"> When these cash-flows are received in and paid out. > How the policyholder will behave (e.g. if and when policyholders decide to stop paying into their policies). Risk Description Insurance risks comprise mortality, longevity, morbidity, lapse, expense, and catastrophe risks. These risks could cause losses from the changing level, trend or volatility of claims as well as by a single catastrophic event. Mortality risk This relates to the risk of loss from higher than expected mortality rates. We are exposed to mortality risks through individual and group insurance policies, which pay benefits to insured policyholders upon death. Longevity risk This relates to the risk of loss from lower than expected mortality rates. We are exposed to longevity risk primarily through annuity contracts, where regular payments are made to policyholders while the policyholder is alive. Morbidity risk This relates to the risk of loss from higher than expected levels of illness or injury, or lower than expected rates of recovery from illness or injury. We are exposed to morbidity risk when we sell income-replacement contracts (which pay a replacement income to policyholders who are unable to work due to illness or injury) and through specified-illness cover policies (which pay a lump sum on diagnosis of one of a number of specified illnesses). Lapse risk This is the risk of losses due to policy-holders ending their contracts early. Expense risk This is the risk of losses due to higher than expected expenses that we incur when administering our business. This includes the impact of inflation rates on expenses. Catastrophe risk This relates to losses caused by catastrophic events, for example a pandemic affecting the population or an industrial accident at a single location. We are exposed to catastrophe risk on our insured business, particularly where we provide group insurance C.1 UNDERWRITING RISK coverage for the lives of many people who routinely work at the same location. Throughout 2022 we were exposed to each of these insurance risks. Risk Assessment and Mitigation We use a series of techniques to assess, manage and mitigate underwriting risks. Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) We assess all material risks, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as part of the annual ORSA process. Risk limits We have a series of risk limits that measure risk exposure from different sources of underwriting risk. Our Risk Function monitors these limits and reports on them each quarter to the Executive Risk Management Committee and the Board Risk Committee.",493
123,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"By monitoring exposures, we can see trends in the risk profile over time and identify material deviations from business plans or from our appetite for each risk. Stress testing We use stress testing as part of the ORSA process to assess risk exposures and their potential impact. Stress testing can also be useful in helping us decide how to mitigate our exposure to risk. Reinsurance We set retention limits to restrict the insurance risks we retain that relate to an individual policy or a group of exposures. We reinsure amounts that are more than the limits. Assumption/experience monitoring When writing an insurance policy, we make a series of assumptions around the insurance experience that will unfold over the term of the contract. If the actual experience is worse than we assumed, the result will be lower profits or even losses. Our Actuarial Function investigates insurance risk experience for our main exposures every year. This allows the Chief Actuary and the Board to assess the suitability of the assumptions made when pricing business, setting reserves and calculating the value of our liabilities for inclusion in our financial statements. Each year, after considering recommendations from the Chief Actuary, the Board approves the assumptions used to determine the value of our liabilities in relation to our insurance policies upon recommendation from the Board Audit Committee. The Executive Risk Management Committee and the Board Risk Committee also review the insurance risk experience each year. We monitor risk experience against assumed/expected experience regularly through monthly business division management information, budget tracking and quarterly profit reporting. If this regular monitoring identifies a potential deviation in experience, the Actuarial Function investigates and feeds back into the pricing and reserving processes, as appropriate. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202237 Underwriting Our underwriting process includes an assessment of insurance risks before we issue policies. This assessment includes a medical underwriting assessment and a financial assessment for certain product lines. We also carry out underwriting assessments when a claim is made. Risk pricing We control the development of new products and the pricing of new and existing products to minimise the risk of underwriting risks at a loss. The profitability of new and existing products depends on the applicable experience assumptions used to price the product (e.g. expense, claim and investment experience assumptions). We monitor the profitability of new business against targets set through our annual budget process. Our operating divisions regularly monitor and report on sales volumes and profitability levels. We report results to the Board each quarter.",479
124,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Risk Concentration Our insurance concentration risks take a number of forms: > We operate within Ireland, and a significant portion of the Irish population lives in the greater Dublin area, so our insurance risk exposure is relatively concentrated to a specific place. This is an on-strategy risk for us and we do not seek to reduce it. > Individual policyholders with large sums assured can lead to some concentration risk. We actively manage this risk by using reinsurance. We reinsure large policies so that the retained sum assured is limited to the maximum amount we have set. > We actively write group business and can face site concentration risk as a result. We use reinsurance to manage this risk. > The sale of annuities to pension schemes can lead to longevity risk exposures concentrated in certain industries. Our portfolio is large and diverse, which reduces this concentration risk. We further reduce this risk with tailored pricing and by using reinsurance. Sensitivities / stress testing You can find out more about the stress testing and sensitivity analysis we carry out in section C.7.1 (Risk Sensitivities). Risk Description Market risks comprise equity/property risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and liquidity risk (see section C.4 (Liquidity Risk)). We are willing to accept market risk in certain circumstances as a consequence of our business model and seek to mitigate the risk wherever practical by matching our assets and liabilities. Equity risk This relates to losses due to falls in equity prices. We have no significant direct shareholder investments in equity markets. We do give policyholders access to equity markets through unit- linked products. Any gains or losses from those investments are incurred by policyholders. However, we are indirectly exposed to market levels as our charges depend on the value of the unit- linked funds. So if fund values fall due to falls in equity markets, our charges will fall as well. We also have some products, which are now closed, that provide investment guarantees. Property risk This relates to losses due to falls in property prices. It is similar to equity risk in that we also have indirect exposure to property market levels through charges collected from unit-linked funds. In addition, we have some direct property holdings, mainly owner-occupied premises. Currency risk This relates to losses due to changes in currency exchange rates. We have no significant direct exposure to currency market levels, as we hedge exposures that arise. It is similar to our equity risk exposure, in that we have indirect exposure to currency markets.",499
125,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"If a change in currency exchange rates affects the value of unit-linked funds, it will also affect the value of the charges we collect. Interest rate risk This relates to losses due to changes in interest rates. The values of our liabilities linked to insurance policies are sensitive to prevailing long-term interest rates. However, we largely mitigate C.2 MARKET RISK SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202238 this exposure by holding assets whose values also move when interest rates change, offsetting the change in the values of our liabilities. Inflation risk This relates to losses due to changes in inflation rates. Some of our policies pay benefits to policyholders that increase in line with prevailing inflation rates, so higher than expected inflation rates may lead to losses. We partly mitigate this risk by holding assets that have a higher return when inflation rates are higher. Defined benefit pension schemes An indirect source of our market risks relates to the risk of economic loss caused by uncertainty around required contributions to our defined benefit pension schemes. We consider this risk to be a part of expense risk as a deterioration in the pension scheme position could lead to the need for greater contributions from the employer, which would increase expenses. Deterioration in the pension scheme position could stem from adverse market movements affecting the value of the pension schemes assets or liabilities. Risk Assessment and Mitigation We use a series of techniques to assess, manage and mitigate market risks. ORSA We assess all material risks, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as part of our annual ORSA process. Risk limits We have a series of risk limits that measure market risk exposure from different sources.

Stress testing We use stress testing as part of the ORSA process to assess risk exposures. Stress testing can also be useful in helping us decide how to mitigate our exposure to risk. Asset Liability Matching (ALM) We invest in matching assets to mitigate the market risks linked to policy liabilities. > We invest in unit-linked assets to match the surrender value of unit-linked policies. > We mitigate the interest rate and inflation rate exposure of non-linked products by matching liabilities with appropriate assets. That means the value of the liabilities and assets move by similar levels when interest and inflation rates change.",497
126,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"> We mitigate currency risk by holding assets of the same currency as liabilities or by hedging currency risks that arise. Equity hedge We operate an equity hedge to partially mitigate certain residual exposure to equity risk. Reinsurance We reinsure some market risks, including risks linked to certain legacy unit-linked products that gave investment guarantees to policyholders. Prudent investment strategy We invest our assets prudently, including assets that back policy liabilities and other shareholder assets. This is in line with the Prudent Person Principle, as required by Solvency II regulations. You can find out more in section B.3.6 (Investments  Prudent Person Principle) about how we apply this. Our investment principles include: > Establishing strategic asset limits to make sure our investments are appropriately diversified. > Maintaining a high level of liquidity, above the level we foresee we will need. > Restricting the use of derivatives to make sure we only hold these instruments to manage investments efficiently or reduce investment risk. > Keeping shareholder investments in equity/property assets low. The Executive Investment Management Committee also oversees our market risks through its oversight of the companys investments. Risk Concentration Our shareholder assets include owner-occupied properties in a single campus in central Dublin. Other than these assets, we do not have any significant concentrated holdings of individual equity or property assets. You can find out more about concentration risks linked to our fixed interest assets holdings in section C.3 (Credit Risk). Sensitivities / Stress testing You can find out more about the stress testing and sensitivity analysis we carry out in section C.7.1 (Risk Sensitivities). SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202239 Risk Description Credit risk relates to risks from a counterpartys potential inability or unwillingness to meet its obligations. Our counterparties include sovereign governments and corporate entities who issue fixed interest assets, reinsurers, insurance intermediaries, policyholders and derivative counterparties. Our main source of credit risk is investments in fixed interest assets issued by borrowers, including sovereign governments and corporate entities. These assets are highly liquid and traded on various market exchanges. Credit risk also stems from deposits and other assets we place with banks. We cede insurance risk to reinsurance companies to mitigate our insurance risk, and are willing to accept the resulting reinsurance counterparty risk within the limits we have set.",475
127,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Similarly, we are willing to accept derivative counterparty risk because we use derivatives to mitigate other risks, but have set limits in relation to this. We are also willing to accept credit risk that results from our business model, e.g. through our dealings with group clients, brokers, intermediaries, policyholders, suppliers, service providers etc. Risk Assessment and Mitigation We use a series of techniques to assess, manage and mitigate credit risk. ORSA We assess all material risks, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as part of the annual ORSA process. Risk limits We have a series of risk limits that measure credit risk exposure from different sources. Our Risk Function monitors these limits and reports on them each quarter to the Executive Risk Management Committee and the Board Risk Committee. By monitoring exposures we can see trends in the risk profile over time and identify material deviations from business plans or from our appetite for each risk. C.3 CREDIT RISK Stress testing We use stress testing as part of the ORSA process to assess risk exposures. Stress testing can also be useful in helping us decide how to mitigate our exposure to risk. Prudent investment strategy Our overarching investment strategy involves targeting a diversified portfolio of assets from counterparties that are in the upper tier for credit quality. We establish limits by referring to aggregate portfolio and individual counterparty limits, as applicable. We then link these to credit ratings that assess the financial strength/creditworthiness of counterparties. Implementation of this investment strategy is overseen by the Executive Investment Management Committee, Executive Risk Management Committee, and the Board. Reinsurance In relation to our reinsurers, we deal only with counterparties that meet our specific creditworthiness requirements. We actively monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers. We also seek contractual protection such as collateral and offset rights where appropriate. Risk Concentration We have set fixed interest and cash counterparty credit risk limits to manage credit concentration risk. Our largest counterparty is the German sovereign. Our operations also lead to some concentration risk exposure linked to reinsurance counterparties. We diversify across reinsurers to reduce this risk. We also look for collateral, where appropriate, to reduce the risk. Sensitivities / Stress testing You can find out more about the stress testing and sensitivity analysis we carry out in section C.7.1 (Risk Sensitivities). Risk Description Liquidity risk stems from a companys inability to generate the necessary funds to meet its obligations as they fall due.",496
128,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Our business model does not lead to significant liquidity risk as we hold assets that are greater than the value of our liabilities. Our business model is also cash-generating. Risk Assessment and Mitigation We monitor and assess potential liquidity risk regularly. Day-to-day/expected liquidity strains For day-to-day liquidity needs, we maintain adequate funds in instant-access bank accounts. Our Finance Function monitors and maintains balances daily. C.4 LIQUIDITY RISK SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202240 The need to pay policyholders is the main generator of ongoing liquidity needs. For unit-linked policies, we fund claims by selling the unit-linked assets. For non-linked policies, we make sure liquid resources are available when we need them by investing in assets that generate cash when we need it to pay benefits to our policyholders. Unexpected liquidity strains Unexpected liquidity strains can stem from a number of sources. These include higher-than-expected insurance claims and collateral calls linked to derivatives or reinsurance arrangements. Liquidity strains could also arise from higher than expected policyholder encashment requests, if the assets held by ILA prove to be difficult to liquidate - for example, high levels of surrender requests from unit-linked property funds may cause a liquidity strain if the underlying properties held by the funds are difficult to sell in a timely manner. We invest our assets to make sure we have ample liquidity to meet unexpected liquidity needs. We have established minimum and maximum strategic investment limits for different liquid and illiquid asset categories. We hold significant assets to provide solvency capital cover for the company. These also act as a buffer for unexpected liquidity strains. Sensitivities / Stress testing The Risk Function carries out regular stress testing to make sure we have sufficient liquidity to meet conceivable needs, even during times of severe strain. We report the results of stress testing each quarter to the Executive Risk Management Committee and the Board Risk Committee. The stress testing considers the potential liquidity strains we face. We compare these liquidity strains to the available liquid assets to make sure the available assets exceed our requirements. Risk Concentration As noted earlier, most of our insurance risks are located in Ireland. The associated concentration risk could lead to material liquidity strains from higher-than-expected insurance claims, as described above. And as explained above, high levels of surrender requests from unit-linked property funds could cause some liquidity strain. Most of the properties held by these funds are located in Ireland.",485
129,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"Our stress testing of liquidity risk captures these factors, and we hold ample liquidity to address the risk. C.4.1 Expected profit included in future premiums The regulations require us to state in this report the amount of expected profit included in future premiums. This is the amount by which our liabilities are reduced due to the premiums expected from our policyholders in the future. When calculating our liability values we only include future premiums for certain policy types, in line with the requirements of the regulations. At the end of 2022, expected profit included in future premiums was 287m (2021: 291m). This figure includes the impact of reinsurance but does not include any impact on tax provisions. The value of our liabilities is reduced by this amount, which leads to a higher net asset position - i.e. a higher level of capital available. However, the amount of capital we have to hold also increases as a result of recognising these future premiums and so the higher capital available must be kept within the company to meet the higher requirement. When we assess whether our liquid resources are adequate, as described above, we do not count the expected profit included in future premiums as it is not a liquid asset. Risk Description Operational risk is the risk linked to inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risks relate to all business processes. We accept limited operational and other risks as part of our business model. We have controls in place to mitigate them through integrated and complementary policies, procedures, processes and practices, keeping in mind the cost/benefit trade-off. We advise customers about their financial needs, and this causes operational risks. We use best management practices to mitigate and manage this risk. Operational risks also include the risk of failing to identify and comply with new or emerging legal and regulatory requirements. To mitigate such risks and factor them in to new business decisions, we monitor regulatory developments closely, keep in regular contact with relevant regulators and capitalise on our internal communication processes. Strategic risk stems from the potential inability to implement appropriate business plans and strategies, make decisions, allocate resources or anticipate business change. We instigate strategic risk management at the individual business division level and consolidate it upwards. Our senior leadership team makes decisions at the ILA level for subsequent review and approval by the Board.",467
130,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"C.5 OPERATIONAL RISK SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202241 Risk Assessment and Mitigation The Risk Function co-ordinates operational risk management activities. In addition, the Internal Audit Function is key to auditing the processes and associated controls that manage operational risks. We record operational risks, their associated controls and associated loss events for each of our business divisions. We identify our top operational risks and assess them for specific monitoring. We maintain Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) for each top operational risk, and report on these each quarter as part of a risk dashboard to the Operational Risk Committee (ILA ORC). This committee escalates operational risk issues as appropriate to the Board Risk Committee. The ILA ORC also receives quarterly reports on actual loss events and additional reporting on significant losses. We also monitor a series of risk limits and report on them each quarter to the ILA ORC. In addition, the Risk Function reports risk limits and operational risk KRIs each quarter, with commentary, to the Board Risk Committee. As part of the annual ORSA process, we assess our operational risks both qualitatively and quantitatively. Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is an important part of mitigating operational risks. It helps ensure continuity of business in a crisis situation. Our Board has approved a BCP framework that applies across our business units. Stress testing is another tool in assessing operational risks. We carry out a range of operational risk stress tests each year. These help us develop our approaches to mitigation and management of operational risk. We will not take on opportunities if we think they pose a risk to our reputation. When we design products and advice processes for customers, we consider any potential impact on our reputation. As part of a large insurance group, we have a number of relationships with other group companies and rely on them for certain services. Our oversight and management of operational risks includes these shared service arrangements.  We have formal outsourcing agreements in place to manage external and inter-group outsourcing arrangements. These agreements set out the responsibilities of both parties and we monitor and review them regularly. This level of formality ensures we manage the associated risks with appropriate rigour. Risk Concentration Our business operations and policy administration are based mainly in a single campus in Dublin, with a second administration centre in Dundalk. We have centred most of the servicing of policies in these locations.",479
131,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"We have partially mitigated the associated concentration risks through business continuity planning, which includes potential to carry out operations from alternative locations and an ability to widely deploy remote working capability. In case of an incident at the Dublin campus, we use off-site centres for data backup and restoration. We have noted other concentration risks, such as providing insurance products within Ireland, in sections C.1 to C.4 above. No other items to note. C.7.1 Risk sensitivities We use a number of sensitivity tests to understand the volatility of our capital position. We regularly produce sensitivity tests on our key risk exposures to help inform our decision-making and planning processes, and as part of the framework we use to identify and quantify our risks. Like every long-term business, we make a number of assumptions when we compile our financial results. These assumptions relate to future expense, mortality and other insurance experience rates, and policyholder lapse rates. Our assumptions are informed by an analysis of historic and expected experience. We have set out the results of key risk sensitivity tests below. We produce these results from our financial reporting models. For each sensitivity test, we have shown the impact of a change in a single factor, and left other assumptions unchanged. You can see the change in our Solvency Capital Requirements (SCR) coverage ratio that would result from the sensitivities shown. Interest rates The impact of a 0.5% increase or decrease in market interest rates. The test considers the impact on the value of our liabilities, net of reinsurance, offset by changes to the value of the assets we hold.C.6 OTHER MATERIAL RISKS C.7 ANY OTHER INFORMATION SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202242 Credit spreads The impact of a 0.5% increase in credit spreads on corporate bonds and our other non-sovereign assets.

Equity/property market values The impact of a 10% fall in the market value of equity and property assets. Expenses The impact of a permanent 10% increase in maintenance expenses. Lapses The impact of a permanent 10% increase or decrease in policyholder lapse rates.

The estimated useful lives are as follows: Office equipment  5 - 10 years Fixtures and fittings 5 - 10 years Computer hardware 3 - 10 years Motor vehicles    5 years Lease assets On initial application of IFRS16 the company calculated right- of-use assets on a lease by lease basis by calculating the lease liabilities of all outstanding leases (see section D.3). Right-of- use assets were equal to lease liabilities at initial application; Right-of-use assets were subsequently adjusted for onerous lease provisions. The company measured its right-of-use assets at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The company also adjusted its right-of-use assets for any re-measurement of lease liabilities where applicable. The company depreciates its right-of-use assets from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of useful life or end of lease term.

The value is based on the value of the underlying assets to which the contracts are linked. Other technical provisions are calculated as a best estimate plus a risk margin, as discussed in the sections below. D.2.1.2 Best estimate technical provisions Best estimate technical provisions (BETPs) represent the best estimate of the value of our obligations under the policies we have written. The BETPs represent the probability-weighted average of future cash-flows, taking into account the time value of money. To allow for the time value of money we use the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure. D.2.1.3 Reinsurance recoverables We have a number of reinsurance arrangements in place which reduce our exposure to risks such as mortality risk, morbidity risk and longevity risk. We work out the value of reinsurance recoverables in the following manner: The present value of the payments we expect to receive from reinsurers (under existing reinsurance arrangements) minus The present value of the payments we expect to make to reinsurers (under existing reinsurance arrangements)In general, the way we work out the value of reinsurance recoverables is the same as the way we work out the BETPs and in general, we use the same assumptions. We do not have any reinsurance arrangements with special purpose vehicles. D.2.1.4 Risk margin The risk margin is meant to represent the extra premium that another insurer would require for taking on our insurance portfolio. It reflects the cost of holding the policy-related capital  the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) - for all our policies. We work out the risk margin in the following manner: The present value of the projected capital on our existing business multiplied by a cost-of-capital rate where the future capital in any given year is equal to the projected SCR arising on our existing business in that year. EIOPA has prescribed a cost-of-capital rate of 6%. We work out our aggregate risk margin and then split it between the lines of business, as in the table above.

143,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"For most of our business, we use a projection of future cash-flows based on central assumptions. We make an adjustment to reflect a best estimate of catastrophe costs. In some cases we use different methods, which we discuss in the sections below covering the individual lines of business. These are the three main categories of assumptions we use to work out the BETPs and reinsurance recoverables: > Demographic assumptions; > Expense assumptions; > Economic assumptions. Demographic assumptions: include assumptions about how long policyholders will live, the rate at which they will die or get ill, and how many of them will let their policies lapse. We discuss these assumptions in the sections below that cover the demographic assumptions on each of the individual lines of business. Expense assumptions: include assumptions about maintenance and investment expenses. We have set the expense assumptions based on the most recent expense investigation. We have taken into account the level of expenses we expect from different types of products and the amount of business in force. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202252 The main economic assumptions are: > The discount rate. > The rate of investment return on unit-linked funds. > The rate of increase of future benefits which are linked to inflation. > Expense inflation. We project future investment returns on unit-linked funds using the risk free yield curve specified by the EIOPA. We use the same risk free yields to discount the value of future cash-flows. We use the yield curve with the volatility adjustment for calculating BETPs (We discuss the volatility adjustment further in section D.2.5 Long Term Guarantee Measures). In line with the Solvency II requirements, we do not use the volatility adjustment when we work out the risk margin. Our assumption about the inflation of future benefits is set considering the results of stochastic modelling. This considers a large number of possible future inflation scenarios. Our assumption about the inflation of expenses is based on long term assumptions about how we expect prices to go up, plus how we expect salaries to go up in excess of prices. Our approach for working out expense and economic assumptions is similar across all lines of business. Other than the difference in the yield curve noted above, the projected capital requirements we use to calculate the risk margin are based on the same assumptions we use to calculate the BETPs.",461

D.2.2.2 Demographic assumptions: Other Life Insurance This line of business includes annuity business, individual and group non-linked protection business.

We work these out based on a number of assumptions. We explain the main assumptions in section D.2.1 Solvency II Technical Provisions and Reinsurance Recoverables: Overview above. There is inherent uncertainty. Actual experience may differ from our assumptions over time, and this may result in us changing our assumptions in the future. Some of the key sources of uncertainty within the BETPs are the rate at which policyholders will die or get ill, how long they live, how many of them will let their policies lapse, and expenses. > If the rate at which life insurance policyholders die  the mortality rate  or the rate at which they get ill  the morbidity rate  goes up, so will our BETPs. We partly mitigate against this uncertainty with our reinsurance arrangements. > If people with annuities from us live longer, our BETPs go up. Again we partly mitigate against this uncertainty with reinsurance arrangements on some annuity blocks. > Generally, if more policyholders let their policies lapse  a higher lapse rate  our BETPs go up. This is because the BETPs allow for the expected value of future profits, which will go down if more policyholders let their policies lapse. > If expenses go up, so will our BETPs. Our BETPs also vary depending on market movements, in particular movements in interest rates and the equity and property markets. When interest rates change, the impact on our BETPs is usually offset, to a broad extent, by changes in the value of the assets backing our BETPs.",487

The basis of how we value our liabilities for IFRS is different from the basis Solvency II requires. The main differences are: Investment contracts IFRS allow for some recognition of future profits, through the recognition of Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) asset, net of the Deferred Front End Fees (DFEF). Solvency II gives a greater allowance for the present value of future profits on investment contracts within the BETPs, subject to some restrictions. Insurance contracts There are three main differences in the approach to valuing insurance contracts: 1. Under IFRS, we value insurance contracts using best estimate assumptions, but we allow for margins for adverse deviation. These margins allow for the possibility of mis-estimation and for our best estimate assumptions deteriorating in the future. The margins also provide reasonable assurance that insurance contract liabilities cover a range of possible outcomes. Under Solvency II, we value all contracts (both investment and insurance contracts) using best estimate assumptions and a prescribed yield curve. We also allow for the risk associated with the business (quantified as the cost of capital) through the risk margin. 2. Under IFRS, the liability on any policy which is allowed to surrender is subject to a floor of zero. Under Solvency II, there is no similar restriction on liability valuations. 3. Under IFRS, for participating business, the value of liabilities in the financial statements does not allow for future terminal dividends.",490

The valuation adjustment to other provisions is in relation to Deferred Front End Fees (DFEF). Solvency II purposes: IFRS reporting purposes: The company derives the value of each provision by management reviewing and evaluating the expected outflow required to settle the liability to which the provision applies. These reviews are presented to the Board Audit Committee for approval and inclusion in the Qualitative Reporting Templates (QRTs). Similar to DAC, as per Article 12 of the Delegated Act, DFEF are valued at nil for Solvency II purposes.Initial fees earned and incremental costs (mainly commission) paid on sale of an investment contract are deferred and recognised over the expected life of the contract. The company estimates the expected life of the contracts based on current experience and the term of the contracts. The company reviews this at least once a year. The maximum amortisation period for DFEF is 20 years. Note 2: Pension benefit obligations We operate a defined benefit pension scheme and a hybrid scheme with a defined benefit element. Some staff participate in a defined benefit pension scheme - an Irish scheme sponsored by Canada Life Irish Holding Company Limited (CLIH), a member of the Canada Life Group. These schemes are closed to new members and from 30 June 2018, were closed to future accrual. Existing members have joined our defined contribution plan for future service pension provision beyond this date. Members have retained the benefits they accrued up to the date of closure of the schemes and these benefits are still linked to final salary. These schemes are funded by contributions into separately administered trust funds. The benefits paid from the defined benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees final pensionable pay for each year of credited service. Under the rules of each of the Irish Life schemes, pension increases are wholly at the discretion of the schemes principal employer. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202258 Solvency II purposes: IFRS reporting purposes: The net obligation of the companys defined benefit schemes represent the present value of the obligation to employees in respect of services to date, less the fair value of the plan assets.

When calculating a net deferred tax liability, deferred tax assets are offset only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. The tax rate used to calculate the deferred tax balance is the rate thats expected to be in-force at the time the tax becomes payable. There is no expiry date of taxable temporary differences. Solvency II purposes: IFRS reporting purposes: Article 15 of the Delegated Act dictates how the company accounts for deferred tax. It says that the company should: > Recognise and value deferred taxes in relation to all assets and liabilities, including technical provisions. > Value deferred taxes on the basis of the difference between the values ascribed to assets and liabilities recognised and valued in accordance with Article 82 of SI 485 of the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 and in the case of technical provisions in accordance with Articles 83 to 98 and the values ascribed to assets and liabilities as recognised and valued for tax purposes.",425

These payments were discounted using an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) based on a group borrowing rate. The company will increase its lease liabilities to reflect the interest charge and will reduce the liabilities for any lease payments made. The company will remeasure lease liabilities if there are any lease modifications or if there is a change in the lease payments. The lease liability shall also be re-measured by the company if there is a change in either the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. These remeasurements may also lead to a change in the discount rate used. Minor leases held by the Company have been identified and assessed.

157,ILA_SFCR_2022.txt,"D.4 AL TERNATIVE METHODS FOR VALUATION Overview of methodology for valuing invested assets The Technical Specification (EIOPA 14/209) outlines the Solvency II rules on how to value assets and liabilities, other than technical provisions. It says that, unless otherwise stated, the default reference framework should be the international accounting standards, as adopted by the European Commission in line with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002. In most cases those international accounting standards (IFRS) and Solvency II give consistent valuations. For our annual statutory financial statements we recognise assets and liabilities in line with IFRS. For our regulatory reporting we follow Central Bank guidelines. As required under IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement), our annual audited statutory financial statements disclose how we value assets and liabilities across level 1, 2 and 3. This is the fair value hierarchy. > Level 1: fair value measurements based on quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. > Level 2: fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). > Level 3: fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset and liability that are based on unobservable market data. Level 1 and 2 show whats known as a mark to market approach. This means values are based on readily available prices in orderly transactions that are sourced externally. Level 3 shows a marked to model approach. This means values are based on assumptions or financial models. Where assets are marked to model the relevant primary investment manager must maintain supporting documentation addressing: > A description of the process followed (model design) and the data/assumptions used by the approach (including assessment of data quality). > The reason why a mark to market approach is not possible. > The sign-off process applied in reviewing the valuation and other applicable controls (such as any applicable benchmarking of valuation output to other comparable methods). > The level of uncertainty inherent in the valuation approach and an assessment of the models performance in this case, which should include any particular circumstances where the approach would be expected to be ineffective.",492

SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202262 At least once a year, the relevant primary investment manager presents a report to our Board Audit Committee for review and approval. The report outlines how the manager priced the asset, what management considered appropriate and the resulting valuation of unquoted securities we hold. These unquoted securities primarily consist of bonds, venture capital and unit trusts. The ILA Reporting Committee (ILARC) is made up of the Chief Financial Officer (Chairperson), Head of Actuarial Function, Executive Manager ILA Group Valuation and Reporting, Head of Group Finance and Executive Financial Reporting Manager. The ILARC is responsible for ensuring application of the Irish Life Group Financial Reporting and Disclosure Policy. Among other responsibilities, the ILARC is required to assess the relevance and adequacy of the policies associated with the valuation of assets and liabilities at least once a year. This has to include taking into consideration changes in accounting rules and policies as governed by the international accounting standards. For invested assets, we expect that our primary investment managers maintain: > Sufficient independence in valuing assets. > Sufficient documentation of applicable standards and guidelines. > Sufficient control over valuation models. > Sufficient management information. > Consistent governance between internally and externally managed funds. This is set out in our investment management agreements. Where the unit-linked and non-linked investment managers hold units in the same fund, both investment managers will ensure they use the same fund price at the end of each quarter. Where this is not practical, the investment managers will contact the group financial reporting and control team to assess options. If the investment managers propose to use different prices for the same assets at the end of the financial year, this will be brought to the attention of the Board Audit Committee and set out the reasoning behind their proposal. The Board Audit Committee will review and, if appropriate, ratify the proposal. We base estimates and associated assumptions on experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These factors are reflected in our judgements about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not objectively verifiable.

Changes in own funds in 2022 Overall, Own Funds have decreased by 176m in 2022. The 176m decrease is mostly due to: > The impact of investment market returns during 2022 on the insurance business. > Dividend payments to our parent company during 2022, partly offset by. > The portfolio transfer of Ark Life. > Margins which emerged from our existing business. Movements in the companys Own Funds in the future will depend on the companys experience and dividend payments. We intend to manage our Own Funds so that the solvency position stays within a targeted range, as noted at the beginning of Section E.1 Own Funds. Deferred taxes The companys Own Funds include a deferred tax liability of 156m at 31 December 2022. This reflects tax that is expected to be paid in the future, if the future profits reflected in Own Funds arise as expected, and on undeclared surplus on net life business (as described in Section D.3.2, Note 4). No deferred tax asset is held under Solvency II at year end 2022.Ring-fenced funds We have three ring-fenced funds relating to our pension schemes, and two ring-fenced funds relating to our Participating Business.",476

This relates to the excess of the surplus over the SCR in our ring-fenced Participating Funds. For our pension schemes, the excess of liabilities over assets is 0.0m (2021: 1.0m). We show this on the balance sheet as a liability, and so it does not result in any additional available assets. As a result, we do not need to make any deductions to Own Funds relating to these pension schemes. Deductions to own funds and restrictions on transferability There are no other deductions to Own Funds. There are also no significant restrictions on how we can transfer our Own Funds. Limits on eligibility of capital The limits on eligible Tier 2 capital, Tier 3 capital and restricted Tier 1 capital have no impact on our eligible Own Funds to cover the SCR.

This mainly impacts the market risk category. In Appendix 6, the SCR for each risk category is shown before allowing for the loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions, and the loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions is shown separately. Another reason for a difference in the SCRs in comparison to Appendix 6 is how the adjustment for diversification due to ring fenced funds is allocated to the individual SCRs. The presentation of the QRT in Appendix 6 is in line with the EIOPA SFCR guidelines. The SCR decreased by 155m during 2022, from 1,179m at 31 December 2021 to 1,024m at 31 December 2022. The decrease is mainly due to: > A 206m decrease in the Market Risk, primarily due to poor market performance during 2022. > A 26m decrease in the Life Underwriting Risk, mainly due to the impact of interest rate movements over 2022. > A 49m decrease in the Health Underwriting Risk, primarily due to the impact of interest rate movements during 2022. > A 23m increase in Operational Risk mainly due to new business growth. > A 68m decrease in diversification benefits. E.2.1 Use of simplified methods Every stress or shock impact we used to calculate our overall SCR was produced separately on a full calculation basis. This means that we do not use any of the simplifications allowed in the Delegated Acts when we calculate the SCR except for the ones mentioned below. We did use some simplifications when we worked out the counterparty SCR: > We used a simple 85% factor to reduce the value of the collateral assets for reinsurance (excluding funds withheld), which allowed for market risk. > For Retail Life, we split the overall risk mitigating effect from reinsurance by counterparty.",493

E.2.3 Loss Absorbing Capacity of Deferred Taxes The SCR has been reduced by 146m for the loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes. This reflects that if the company incurs losses due to adverse experience there will be a reduction in the tax paid by the company. The source of the loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes is the deferred tax liability of 156m at year-end 2022. As noted in Section E.1, Own Funds allow for a deferred tax liability of 156m. The SCR calculation anticipates stress events which reduce the value of future profits. The occurrence of these stress events would also mean that this tax liability would not arise.

Bancassurance Partnership between a bank and an insurance company to allow a bank to sell insurance products. Bear market A bear market is when prices of securities fall sharply, and a sweeping negative view causes the sentiment to further entrench itself. As investors anticipate losses in a bear market and selling continues, pessimism grows. BPS Basis points (BPS) refers to a common unit of measure for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001, and is used to denote the percentage change in a financial instrument.Bulk annuity A group of policies written by an insurer that pays retirement income to policyholders.

Capital at risk The loss that an insurance company would make if someone with a policy dies. The capital at risk for any policy cannot be less than zero. It is calculated like this: > The amount that the company would pay if the person died, minus. > The amount that the company would receive from reinsurers if the person died, under its reinsurance arrangements, minus. > The technical provisions minus reinsurance recoverables that the company holds for that policy. The total capital at risk is the sum of the capital at risk for all the policies the company has written. Correlation factors Factors which reflect the relationships between the risks included in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement. Defined Contribution Defined contribution (DC) schemes are occupational pension schemes where a customers contributions and their employers contributions are both invested and the proceeds used to buy a pension and/or other benefits at retirement. The value of the ultimate benefits payable from the DC scheme depends on the amount of contributions paid, the investment return achieved less any fees and charges, and the cost of buying the benefits. SOLVENCY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REPORT 202271 Delegated act One of the tools the EU uses to put a law in place. Generally, they use an implementing act for ruling on procedure and on how to follow legislation that already exists in other acts. They use a delegated act for ruling on the content of legislation. A delegated act might, for example, add or change elements of a piece of legislation that are not fundamental to that legislations essence. The Solvency II regime involves both implementing acts and delegated acts. Derivatives Financial products made up of assets packaged together. The value of the product depends on - or derives from - the value of the underlying assets. The asset could be, for example, currency or a commodity. Futures and options are examples of derivatives.

Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) A set of processes which assess a companys risk profile and the capital it needs to hold in light of these risks. It assesses both the current risk profile, and what it is likely to be in the future. It helps us make decisions, and analyse strategy and risk. In line with standard insurance regulations, we carry out an ORSA each year.

Our domestic business mix is typical of the Irish market, including unit-linked, guaranteed protection, unitised with-profit, annuity, group protection and reviewable protection. The Company also currently writes Life Assurance business in Germany under EU Freedom of Services provisions and previously wrote Life Assurance business in other European markets under EU Freedom of Services and Freedom of Establishment provisions. All territories are closed to new business with the exception of the Republic of Ireland and Germany. ZLAPâs Italian Branch, which was established in late 2009, closed to new business in 2019. The Company entered into a Business Sale Agreement during 2021 to transfer its Italian based policies to Zurich Investments Life S.p.A (ZIL) (the life legal entity of the Zurich Group in Italy). During 2022 all policies written into Italy under Freedom of Services and Freedom of Establishment were transferred to Zurich Investments Life S.p.A. under the requirements of Section 36(1) of the Irish Insurance Act 1989 (as amended).",463
178,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"This transaction reflected the Companyâs strategic plan to exit the Italian market where it has been closed to new business since September 2019, to close the Companyâs Italian Branch and to enhance the operational efficiency and streamline the overall business. Our ultimate holding company is Zurich Insurance Group Ltd which is incorporated in Switzerland. Business Strategy The Company has a Board-approved strategy in place which sets out the Companyâs objectives over a three-year period. Our strategic aspiration is to make it compelling for distributors to partner with Zurich to meet customer needs. Our success to date has been based on our ability to understand and respond to the needs of our distribution partners and customers across all areas of our business (e.g. products, pricing, investment offering, technology and service). Furthermore, we have identified 5 key areas of focus where we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors and take advantage of the identified opportunities in the market. These are: â Relationships; â Ease of doing business; â Innovation; â Agility; and â Investment performance. Performance Overall, the Company had a strong year in 2022 with underwriting performance continuing to be profitable. The Companyâs overall underwriting performance in the financial statements was â¬72.3m for 2022. This is a decrease of â¬10.3m from the underwriting performance of â¬82.7m in 2021. Underwriting performance on the Italian branch book of business, which was transferred to another entity within the Zurich group in 2022, reduced from -â¬1.9m to -â¬6.7m. The underwriting performance for all other territories also decreased in 2022 due to the impacts of demographic experience and investment market performance. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 6 Executive Summary (continued) The Company uses derivative programs to reduce the equity and currency risk exposures within the Solvency II Balance Sheet. For example, under Solvency II, the value of future fund-based fees on unit-linked funds is included in the liabilities and will be matched by the market value movement of the derivatives. However, the derivative programs increase in-year profit and loss volatility in the financial statements as there is a timing difference between the recognition of asset and liability movements which can create gains / losses in a particular year.",498
179,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The market value movement in the value of the derivative assets is recognised in the financial statements immediately but the corresponding change in future fund-based fee income is not recognised until fees are collected from the unit funds over many years into the future. The derivative counterparty is another entity within the Zurich Group. The Company (loss)/profit after taxation on the derivative programs was â¬71.5m in 2022 with an equal and opposite impact for the counterparty. (The (loss)/profit was (â¬115.7m) in 2021.) This impact is due to external equity and currency market movements in the relevant periods. The derivative programs are designed to hedge the economic exposure rather than being tailored to an in-year accounting impact as reported in the Financial Statements. Investment income, based on the returns on shareholder assets and assets backing policyholder liabilities, was -â¬3,557m in 2022 compared with â¬3,642m in 2021. Investment income is dependent on the performance of the financial markets. Investment returns were generally negative in 2022 due to reductions in equity market values and increasing interest rates after seeing significant growth in investment markets during 2021. Investment income on policyholder unit linked assets is closely matched by a corresponding movement in policyholder unit linked liabilities. There were no material changes to the Companyâs business profile in 2022. System of Governance (Section B) ZLAPâs board of directors (âthe Boardâ) is responsible for the governance and oversight of all aspects of the Companyâs business. The Board submits an annual compliance statement to the CBI confirming the Companyâs compliance with relevant obligations including, for example, the Corporate Governance Code. The Board has delegated broad executive powers to the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) to manage and operate the Companyâs business on a day-to-day basis. To support the Board and CEO in dispensing their responsibilities, the Company has established a number of committees which meet regularly to discuss and escalate matters as appropriate. The Company employs a âthree lines of defenceâ model in support of its system of governance. The second line consists of three control functions, Actuarial, Compliance and Risk Management who monitor and challenge the activities of the first line business units such as finance, marketing and product development.",492
180,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The Actuarial function is responsible for providing certain assurances to the Board in relation to the Companyâs ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. The third line consists of the Internal Audit function which provides independent assurance to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework, internal control system and other elements of the system of governance. The Company manages its business in accordance with a number of policies and strategies that underpin the Risk Management Framework. The Risk Management Framework considers all risks related to the Companyâs business, setting out processes which enable those risks to be identified, managed, monitored and mitigated appropriately. The key governing risk management documents are the Risk Management Policy, the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the Companyâs Risk Appetite Framework and Statement, and the Zurich Risk Policy. The Zurich Risk Policy consists of a suite of risk management processes and procedures that set out the Groupâs standards for effective risk management that are adopted by the Company as appropriate. The Companyâs key risk management processes include the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (âORSAâ) which considers a holistic view of the risks faced by the Company on a forward looking basis including an assessment of overall solvency needs, and the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (âRCSAâ) which enables the identification and control of operational risk in our everyday processes. Additionally, our Total Risk Profiling (âTRPâ) process is used to identify and monitor key strategic risks. Risk Profile (Section C) The Company manages a mix of risks typical to a life assurance company operating in Ireland. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 7 Executive Summary (continued) The key risks are Market, Underwriting, Credit and Operational risks. The Company has frameworks in place to monitor and manage all material risks. The risk management frameworks set requirements around the monitoring and measuring of risks, including sensitivity and scenario analysis as required, as well as risk mitigation techniques and the governance around decision making in respect of appropriate risk management. Risks which are less quantifiable through stress testing or other means such as conduct risk are included in these frameworks. At an aggregate level the Companyâs risk profile is largely unchanged over 2022, though the Company continues to review and implement potential risk management initiatives. The Company also continues to enhance its management and oversight of sustainability risk.",499
181,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The Company forecasts its financial position incorporating planned new business and other business initiatives for the duration of its business plan under both best estimate and adverse conditions at least annually. This enables the Company to identify risks to its ongoing financial strength and to take any steps necessary to reduce or remove those risks. The Company has also set thresholds for important risk metrics, defined in the Risk Appetite Statement, which are monitored on a regular basis. Should the metrics approach or exceed the thresholds, appropriate actions are taken to manage the risk. In addition to existing risks, the Company also tracks emerging risks in line with its Emerging Risk Policy. A number of risks have been identified and continue to be monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Valuation for Solvency Purposes (Section D) The main differences between Solvency II and Irish GAAP valuations are driven by the economic valuations under Solvency II including the earlier recognition of profits and losses. In addition to the valuation differences, there are a number of classification differences between Solvency II and Irish GAAP relating to differing accounting treatments under the regimes. Solvency II Technical Provisions decreased in 2022 due to negative fund growth and the transfer of the Italian unit-linked business. Changes in demographic assumptions, in particular mortality, morbidity and longevity assumptions and changes in unit cost assumptions also impacted SII Technical Provisions in 2022. Capital Management (Section E) Overview Own Funds refers to the available financial resources, or excess of assets over liabilities, under the Solvency II regime. The Own Funds at 31/12/2022 were â¬948m (â¬927m at 31/12/2021), 100% of which were classified as Tier 1. The increase in the Own Funds in 2022 is mainly driven by the emergence of profits on existing business which was offset by the effect of negative economic conditions on the Companyâs future fund based fee income. The SCR is a measure of the capital required to be held under the Solvency II regime and amounted to â¬700m at 31/12/2022 (â¬716m at 31/12/2021). The main driver of the decrease in SCR was the negative performance of equity markets in 2022 contributing to lower expected future profits on unit linked business, which in turn has resulted in lower Life Underwriting Risk in particular.",495
182,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The main risk driving this decrease is the risk that policies discontinue and therefore those higher expected future profits donât materialise. ZLAPâs existing derivative programs were reduced to recapture equity and currency risk exposure in 2022. This led to an increase in Market Risk in 2022. The Solvency II SCR ratio (coverage of SCR by Own Funds) was 135% at 31/12/2022 (129% at 31/12/2021). The Central Bank of Ireland (âCBIâ) requires life insurance companies to maintain solvency coverage of at least 100% of the SCR. There was no incidence of non-compliance with this requirement in 2022. The Minimum Capital Requirement (âMCRâ) is the minimum level of available financial resources required and amounted to â¬237m at 31/12/2022 (â¬260m at 31/12/2021). The Companyâs MCR coverage ratio was 400% (coverage of MCR by Own Funds) at 31/12/2022 (357% at 31/12/2021). There was no incidence of non-compliance with the MCR in 2022. It is possible for companies to apply certain long-term guarantee measures such as the matching adjustment and the volatility adjustment when calculating liabilities. Similarly there are transitional measures which can apply for a period of years after the introduction of Solvency II. These measures require approval by the CBI. The Company is not presently using any such measures. Zurich Group Capital Position ZLAP is a company which is part of the Zurich Insurance Group. The Group pools risk, capital and liquidity centrally as much as possible. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 8 Executive Summary (continued) The Group manages its capital to maximize long-term shareholder value while ensuring customer needs are met, maintaining financial strength within its âAAâ target range and meeting regulatory, solvency and rating agency requirements.

Requirements for the SFCR Solvency II became effective on 1 January 2016 for all insurance companies and groups regulated in the European Union. One of the primary aims of Solvency II is to provide a more risk-based approach to calculating and monitoring the required levels of capital for insurance companies. It also introduced a requirement for insurance companies to produce a publicly available Solvency and Financial Condition Report to assist customers and other stakeholders in understanding the types of business written, how it is managed and the overall financial condition of the Company, including the amount of regulatory capital required by and available to the Company. For insurance companies regulated by the CBI, the Solvency and Financial Condition Report is produced in accordance with Article 52 of the Statutory Instrument 485 of 2015, Articles 290 to 303 of the Commission delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 and the EIOPA guidelines on reporting and public disclosure (B05-15-109). 2.

The Other Life Insurance category mainly consists of annuity and term protection policies. Underwriting profits on these business lines depend on mortality, morbidity and longevity experience. The Company uses a panel of highly-rated reinsurance providers to mitigate the impact of the risks associated with changes in demographic experience. Insurance with profit participation is composed of any unit-linked policies where more than 50% of their investments are invested in ZLAPâs Unitised With-Profits funds. The Index-Linked and Unit-Linked Insurance category is ZLAPâs largest line of business and contains all other unit-linked policies. The Companyâs fee income on this business is generally taken as a percentage of the funds under management and will move in line with the value of those underlying funds. There are some additional factors which impact across all of the Companyâs product lines such as persistency and expenses. Persistency levels can have a very significant impact on the value of the Companyâs business. To a large extent persistency experience is dependent on external drivers (e.g. level of discretionary income in the economy), but the Company can (and does) take action to ensure that it is in policyholdersâ interests to retain their Zurich policies for the duration of the original term.",489

Expense control receives significant focus both from local management and from the Zurich Group. Key points to note in relation to the differences between the two periods are: â Total net premiums written were higher in 2022. ZLAP recorded a strong performance in domestic sales in 2022 with increased sales across most product lines. The strong performance in sales in 2022 was offset by negative investment market returns in the unit-linked and index-linked funds which reduced the total Technical Provisions. â Profits on the Index-linked and unit-linked insurance category were lower in 2022 . Profits on the domestic portfolio within this category were negatively impacted by the investment market performance in 2022, decreasing fundbased fee income. The underwriting performance of the Italian portfolio, discussed in more detail below, is also contained within this category. â Underwriting profits on the Other Life line of business were lower in 2022 primarily due to exceptionally favourable experience in 2021. â Profits on the Health Insurance line of business increased in 2022, mainly due to favourable morbidity experience.

The Company uses derivative programs to reduce the equity and currency risk exposures within the Solvency II Balance Sheet. For example, under Solvency II, the value of future fund based fees on unit-linked funds is included in the liabilities and will be matched by the market value movement of the derivatives. However, the derivative programs increase in-year profit and loss volatility in the financial statements as there is a timing difference between the recognition of asset and liability movements which can create gains/losses in a particular year. The market value movement in the value of the derivative assets is recognised in the financial statements immediately but the corresponding change in future fund-based fee income is not recognised until fees are collected from the unit funds over many years into the future. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 15 A.

Against this backdrop, 2021 saw positive overall trends in equity market values whereas 2022 saw an overall reduction in equity market values. Bonds The investment return on bonds includes coupon payments and capital gains/losses from bond market performance. Interest rates increased significantly during 2022 from the historic low/negative interest rate environment seen in 2021.

The Terms of Reference of the Board provide that it will, amongst other matters: â Direct and control ZLAPâs business and set and oversee the strategy; â Provide for the effective, prudent and ethical oversight of ZLAP; â Set and oversee a robust and transparent organisational structure with effective communication and reporting channels; â Set and oversee an effective internal control framework that includes well-functioning Risk Management, Actuarial, Compliance and Internal Audit functions as well as an appropriate financial reporting and accounting framework; â Set and oversee policies on key areas such as: risk, reserving, compliance, internal audit, outsourcing, fitness and probity, business continuity, remuneration and board diversity; â Set risk appetite and overall risk tolerance levels; â Set and oversee the strategy for the management of material risks; and â Review ZLAPâs systems of internal controls. Committees of the ZLAP Board The Board has established the following committees which report directly to it: The Board Audit Committee (âBACâ) assists the Board in controlling, overseeing and coordinating internal and external audit activities and processes. It also monitors the financial reporting process and reviews the annual financial statements and regulatory filings, as well as overseeing the activities of the Compliance function and reviewing any key actuarial reports, including reports on the valuation of the Technical Provisions and any sensitivities therein. The Board Risk Committee (âBRCâ) serves as a focal point for oversight of risk management.",492
195,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"It reviews current exposures and makes recommendations to the Board on ZLAPâs risk appetite and future risk strategy as well as overseeing the Risk Management function. The Nomination Committee assists and supports the Board on matters relating to the composition and membership of the Board and senior appointments within the Company. Amongst other things, it makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of new Board members and other senior roles in the Company and oversees succession planning and compliance with corporate governance requirements in relation to the composition and membership of the Board. The Nomination Committee also plays an active role in diversity and inclusion, including setting targets for Board diversity, monitoring Board succession planning through a diversity lens and monitoring progress made on the strategy and action plans in place for diversity and inclusion (which is also a topic considered by the Board). The Board has elected not to establish a Remuneration Committee and instead relies on the Remuneration Committee which exists at Group level. Executive Management and Management Committees The Board has delegated broad executive powers to the CEO to manage and operate ZLAPâs business. The following key management committees have been established to assist and support the CEO and other senior management in fulfilling their responsibilities: 1.âThe Management Committee assists and supports the CEO in managing and overseeing all the business and operations of ZLAP. 2.âThe Asset Liability Management and Investment Committee (âALMICâ) assists the CEO in managing and overseeing the investment of ZLAPâs portfolio of investment assets in accordance with the investment strategy. 3.âThe With-Profits Committee considers the report of the Head of Actuarial Function on unitised with-profits dividends to be added to policyholdersâ investment accounts and material unitised with-profits matters. 4.âThe Risk and Control Committee (âRCCâ) assists the CEO and members of the Management Committee by providing an integrated assurance forum to manage, control, oversee and co-ordinate risk management, compliance and internal control activities. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 18 B.",444

Further information on the risk management system is contained in Section B.3 of this report. â The Compliance function, led by the Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for promoting an ethics-based culture, delivering compliance solutions and providing assurance. Among other things, the Compliance function advises the Board on compliance with laws and regulations, assesses the impact of changes in the external legal environment and assesses the adequacy of measures taken by ZLAP to prevent non-compliance. Further information on the Compliance function is contained in Section B.4 of this report.",455
197,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"â The Internal Audit function, led by the Legal Entity Head of Internal Audit, is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance to the Board, the BAC and the RCC on the adequacy and effectiveness of ZLAPâs risk management, internal control and governance processes. Further information on the Internal Audit function is contained in Section B.5 of this report. â The Actuarial function, led by the ZLAP Head of Actuarial Function, is responsible for carrying out the regulatory actuarial function activities of ZLAP including the provision of regular reports to the Board on Technical Provisions. Further information on the Actuarial function is contained in Section B.6 of this report. Each of the Risk Management, Compliance and Actuarial functions reports to and has access to the Board independent of their own management reporting line and has the right to receive all relevant information and be appropriately resourced to perform their respective role(s). ZLAPâs Internal Audit function is provided by the Zurich Group Internal Audit function. An appropriate service level agreement requires that sufficient resources with appropriate capability and competence are provided to deliver the audits contained in ZLAPâs approved annual internal audit plan. If the independence or objectivity of the Internal Audit function is impaired, this must be disclosed to the Chairperson of the BAC so that appropriate action can be taken. The table below summarises the regularity with which each of these functions reports to the Board (and/or Board Committee).

198,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The Board has adopted the Zurich Group Remuneration Rules (âZRRâ) as ZLAPâs remuneration policy without material deviation. The ZRR establish a balanced and effectively managed remuneration system for employees which ensures competitive total remuneration opportunities for which the resulting awards are adjusted depending on the results achieved. The short and long-term incentive plans (STIP and LTIP) aim to align the remuneration architecture with the achievement of key financial objectives, the execution of the business strategy, the risk management framework and the operational plans. The ZLAP Board satisfies itself that the remuneration policy does not encourage excessive risk taking. The variable remuneration is largely determined by the achievements against pre-defined financial measures which are aligned with the meeting of strategic objectives. For the most senior employees the remuneration architecture is structured in a way that puts more emphasis on the variable remuneration elements with a higher weighting, on average, towards the long-term. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 20 B. System of Governance (continued) For senior employees a proportion of their remuneration is deferred and is dependent on Company performance. The performance based target shares guaranteed under the LTIP only vest if certain performance criteria of the Zurich Group are met over a three year period. Independent non-executive members of the Board receive fixed remuneration as an annual fee which is not subject to the achievement of any specific performance criteria. Board members and key function holders are, where relevant, members of their respective country pension schemes and all arrangements are subject to the standard rules of those schemes. For Board members and key function holders which are directly employed by the Company, there are no supplementary pension or early retirement arrangements in place. This is aligned with the position for other employees of the Company. Material Transactions with Zurich Group companies during 2022 In 2022 Zurich Ireland Master Trustee Dac (âZIMTâ) was incorporated to act as trustee solely to the Zurich Master Trust which was established in 2021. It is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of ZLAP, with a capital contribution of â¬5m from ZLAP. The Company had a regulated branch in Italy which closed to new business during 2019.",475

(âZILâ) under the requirements of Section 36(1) of the Irish Insurance Act 1989 (as amended). The Company received newly issued shares in ZIL in payment for the transfer of the Companyâs Italian business to ZIL. The Company subsequently sold those shares to Zurich Insurance Company (Italy) for the same purchase value. The Company entered into a licence agreement with Zurich Insurance plc in respect of its use of office space within Zurich House, Frascati Road, Blackrock, County Dublin from the 1st July 2022. ZLAP also have a number of existing reinsurance and derivative arrangements with other entities within the Zurich Group. There were reductions to the coverage of some of the existing derivative programs in 2022. Material changes in the system of governance There were no material changes to the System of Governance during 2022. B.2 Fit and proper requirements Insurance companies must be satisfied that people who perform certain roles comply with standards known as the Fitness and Probity Standards which are issued by the CBI. The Fitness and Probity Standards apply to people who are likely to significantly influence the conduct of the business of ZLAP or who ensure its compliance with relevant obligations. They also apply to people who deal directly with customers, for example in an advisory capacity or with respect to claims and complaints. The Fitness and Probity Standards require those performing these roles to be competent and capable, honest, ethical, act with integrity and be financially sound. The Board has approved a policy and implemented controls to ensure that it meets these requirements. The Company will carry out checks in advance of a person being appointed to such a role to obtain: â Evidence of compliance with certain minimum competency standards; â Evidence of professional qualification(s); â Evidence of Continuing Professional Development (where applicable); â Record of interview and application; â References; â Record of previous experience; and â Satisfactory checks in relation to Central Bank records, sanctions, directorships, judgements, bankruptcies. A person will neither be appointed to a role nor be allowed to remain in a role unless ZLAP is satisfied with the checks carried out.",485

On an annual basis, the relevant checks are re-performed to ensure the individual continues to comply with the relevant standards. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 21 B. System of Governance (continued) B.3 Risk management system including the own risk and solvency assessment Risk management in ZLAP Taking risk is inherent to the insurance business but such risk-taking should only be made in an informed and disciplined manner, and within a pre-determined risk appetite and tolerance. To facilitate a structured approach to risk-taking, an ERM system is embedded in ZLAPâs system of governance. The ERM system is designed to support ZLAPâs decision-making procedures by providing consistent, reliable and timely risk information, protecting ZLAPâs capital and reputation from risks that exceed established risk tolerances. ZLAPâs ERM system considers risks from both a top down and bottom up perspective. The ZLAP CRO is responsible for the implementation and effective operation of the ERM system across ZLAP. The CRO reports on risk matters to the CEO and senior management through the ORC and RCC and to the Board through the BRC. ZLAP has adopted a five pillar approach to Enterprise Risk Management: â Risk Governance; â Risk Culture; â Risk Appetite Framework; â Risk Identification and Risk Assessment; and â Risk Monitoring and Risk Reporting. Through this structured approach, ZLAP maintains an effective ERM system and adheres to the requirements of both the Corporate Governance Requirements in Ireland and the Solvency II regulations in respect of Risk Management. Three lines of defence A âthree lines of defenceâ approach runs through ZLAPâs risk governance structure, so that risks are clearly identified, owned and managed. The role of each of the three lines of defence in the Companyâs system of governance is summarised as follows: â First line: Business management who take risks and are responsible for day-to-day risk management. First line management is responsible and accountable for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of the individual risks that arise in their areas.",499
201,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"â Second line: Governance and control functions consisting of Risk Management, Compliance and Actuarial. They support the first line in managing and controlling specific types of risks. Second line functions are responsible for providing independent oversight and challenge in respect of first line activities. â Third line: The Internal Audit function provides independent assurance regarding the effectiveness of the ERM framework and controls. As part of the ERM system, the Risk Management function supports the Board in setting risk tolerance limits and evaluates breaches and potential breaches as part of the Risk Appetite Framework described below. The Risk Management function and other functions such as Compliance and Actuarial develop and operate methodologies to identify, manage and mitigate designated types of risk. The Risk Management function monitors overall risks, including specific risk-types, and escalates through the system of governance any risk exposures that exceed ZLAPâs risk tolerance. The ERM system is used extensively for decision-making across the business including strategy setting, business planning, product development, and capital management. Risk Appetite Framework ZLAPâs Risk Appetite Framework enables the Company to manage its risks in a controlled manner. It sets out the means by which the Company monitors and manages its risks within parameters approved by the Board. The Risk Appetite Statement reflects the Boardâs appetite for assuming risk exposures across the Companyâs risk profile. It sets out Key Risk Indicators (âKRIsâ) which measure risk exposures as well as limits within which the Company will maintain those exposures. The KRIs included in the Risk Appetite Statement are informed by both top-down processes, such as the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (âORSAâ), and bottom-up processes such as the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (âRCSAâ). Other governing policies Alongside the Risk Appetite Framework, the Board has also approved the ZLAP Risk Management Policy and adopted the Zurich Group Risk Policy which set out principles and standards for Company-wide risk management. They specify ZLAPâs risk tolerance, risk limits and authorities, reporting requirements, procedures to approve any exceptions and procedures for referring risk issues to senior management and the Board. Limits are specified per risk type. Regular assessments verify that requirements are being met. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 22 B.",487
202,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"System of Governance (continued) The Own Risk and Solvency Assessment The ORSA process is a key risk management tool for considering the ongoing suitability and sustainability of the Companyâs strategy in the context of its financial position and risk profile. This annual process provides the Board with both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the risks to which the Company is exposed. The Board is responsible for directing and overseeing the annual ORSA process, challenging the findings and recommendations, and reviewing and approving the ORSA policy and ORSA report. In 2022, the final version of the ORSA report was presented and approved at the December Board meeting. A full copy of this report was also submitted to the CBI. Key elements of the ORSA process include: â A scenario and stress testing exercise to assess ZLAPâs ability to withstand certain shocks while continuing to meet its policyholder obligations framed by its strategic objectives; â An assessment of Overall Solvency Needs (âOSNâ), taking into account the specific risk profile, approved risk tolerance limits and the business strategy of the Company; â An assessment of the significance with which the risk profile of the business deviates from the assumptions underlying the standard formula calculation; and â Confirmation of compliance, on a continuous basis, with the capital requirements and with the requirements regarding Technical Provisions. Stress testing involves assessing the impact of an adverse event or set of conditions related to one risk to which the Company is exposed whereas scenario testing involves an adverse event or set of conditions related to two or more risks. Reverse stress testing, where the Company considers extreme risk events, and qualitative risk assessments are also considered. Through the scenario and stress testing exercise and the qualitative assessments the ORSA provides the Board with a holistic view of the Companyâs resilience to adverse conditions such as reduced levels of new business or a wider economic strain. Where appropriate, the Board may instruct further assessments to be carried out or actions to be taken should the ORSA bring to light any areas where such activities may benefit the Company. ZLAPâs OSN assessment relates to the Companyâs view of its risk profile and related risk capital (assets held by ZLAP over and above those required to meet a best estimate of its policyholder obligations). A level of risk capital in excess of the regulatory requirement is determined which enables the Company to continue to meet regulatory requirements in adverse scenarios.",495
203,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"In determining the OSN the Company engages in an exercise to consider the identification, quantification and management of material risks facing ZLAP, both immediately and over the period of the business plan. These material risks, and ZLAPâs ability to withstand them, are considered through the use of adverse stress and scenario testing quantified both immediately and over the period of the business plan. The regulatory view of risk capital, set out in legislation, prescribes how the Company should determine its risk capital using a methodology known as the standard formula. The standard formula methodology is prescribed by EIOPA and is intended to represent the risk profile of an average or typical (re)insurance undertaking. The Company validates the continued use of this methodology via the assessment of standard formula appropriateness carried out annually. The ORSA process is embedded within ZLAPâs ERM framework. Processes within ZLAP such as the Companyâs capital management process align with the ORSA. The risk and capital assessments and conclusions arising from the ORSA are used within business decision-making processes, including the ongoing development of ZLAPâs strategy, business planning, product development and capital management policy. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 23 B. System of Governance (continued) ZLAPâs ORSA process is summarised in the following diagram: Director Approval of ORSA Policy and Risk Appetite. Business planning, strategy approval. Review of all feedback on the prior year process from regulator, etc. Identification of strategic business risks ('TRP') Agree on sensitivity and scenario testing. Review and approval of regulatory report, including: Stressing of regulatory solvency and economic balance sheet. Controls review, Actuarial Opinion and Directorsâ Accuracy Certification Review Target Capital range. Director review and approval of Capital Management Policy. Assessments of Overall Solvency Needs. Standard Formula Appropriateness. Continuous Compliance. Governance of the ORSA process is set out in ZLAPâs ORSA Policy which is approved by the Board. This policy sets out the following: â Roles and responsibilities within the ORSA process; â Processes and procedures for conducting the ORSA, including the forward looking assessment of own risks and solvency; â Links with the overall Risk and Capital Management System; and â Frequency and timeline of the ORSA report production.",497
204,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The 2022 ORSA process concluded, amongst other things, that ZLAPâs base case projection of capital, incorporating the strategy, is consistent with the Companyâs risk appetite capital adequacy levels and that the Companyâs capital positions are appropriate. Outside of the normal annual process, an out-of-cycle ORSA process may be triggered by events such as a material change in ZLAPâs risk profile including major acquisitions or divestments, major shifts in product mix or major changes in the business, operating or external environment. No such out-of-cycle ORSA process was required during 2022. B.4 Internal control system ZLAPâs internal control system consists of a number of elements. The purpose of these elements is to be complementary and thus foster a comprehensive and effective system overall. The elements are outlined below. ZLAP adopts principles and tools used by the Zurich Group in relation to internal controls, with adaptation to local requirements. ZLAPâs internal control system covers operational processes across all areas of the business. Accountability for each control lies with a senior executive in ZLAP and delegation of responsibility follows a transparent approach subject to governance rules (e.g. control delegate must have sufficient knowledge to perform the control). The certification process, attesting to the implementation and effectiveness of controls, is managed via the Zurich Groupâs Risk and Control Engine (âRACEâ) tool. The ZLAP Risk Management function supports other functional management in the implementation of the risk and control framework across ZLAP and provides challenge as to the effectiveness of the controls in place. The Risk Management function reports on the effectiveness of the internal control framework through ZLAP-wide monitoring of the certification process, controls testing and engaging with local teams when gaps or inconsistencies in the control environment are identified. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 24 B. System of Governance (continued) Risk & Control Identification â Bottom-up approach: The Companyâs bottom-up approach to risk management comprises its RCSA framework, the focus of which is the identification and assessment of the Companyâs risks and the corresponding controls.",453
205,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The aims of the framework are to have a clearly defined process in place for coordinating risk assessments with the first line of defence and to provide a mechanism for the identification, discussion, assessment, management and monitoring of existing/emerging risks and relevant controls, with challenge and support being provided by the Risk Management function in the second line. The RCSA framework is supported by the following: â An RCC-approved policy; â A Risk Taxonomy to guide identification and categorization of risk types; â A âRisk Champion Forumâ to foster engagement and two-way discussions between the first line and Risk Management; â Quarterly attestation to risks and controls by the first line, with oversight and independent control testing by Risk Management; and â Implementation of action plans to remediate any issues arising. This suite of information is reported on RACE. An Operational Risk report summarising the information on RACE is reported to the RCC, BRC and BAC on a quarterly basis. Other elements: Other key elements of ZLAPâs internal controls system include administrative and accounting procedures, appropriate reporting arrangements at all levels of the Company and an established Compliance function which is described below. Compliance function ZLAPâs Compliance function is underpinned by a Compliance Policy and a Compliance Plan. The compliance policy defines the roles, responsibilities, and reporting duties of the Compliance function. The compliance plan sets out the planned activities of the compliance function taking into account all relevant areas of the activities of ZLAP and their exposure to compliance risk. ZLAPâs Compliance function enables and supports the business to comply with rules, regulations and internal requirements by providing policies and guidance, business advice, training and assurance of appropriate compliance controls within its mandate. The Compliance function also supports ZLAPâs management in maintaining and promoting a culture of compliance and ethics consistent with Zurich Groupâs Code of Conduct. Through a comprehensive program the Compliance function implements, embeds and monitors internal compliance with policies and guidance. As part of that program all employees receive regular training on compliance and ethics. Each year, all ZLAP employees confirm their understanding of and compliance with Zurichâs Code of Conduct. The ZLAP Chief Compliance Officer facilitates and supports ZLAP in complying with all applicable regulatory and other compliance requirements within the compliance remit.",480

System of Governance (continued) B.5 Internal Audit function The Internal Audit function for ZLAP is provided by the Zurich Groupâs Internal Audit function (Group Audit). The Legal Entity Head of Internal Audit for ZLAP is responsible for providing assurance to the Board and the BAC on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework, internal control system and other elements of the system of governance. The Board has approved an Internal Audit policy which provides for the development of a risk-based audit plan, based on the full spectrum of business risks and any specific concerns raised by the BAC or other stakeholders. The BAC is responsible for approving the annual audit plan and any subsequent changes. The audit plan is executed in accordance with defined operating standards, which incorporate and comply with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (âIIAâ). Key issues observed by the Internal Audit function as part of their audit work are communicated to the responsible management function, the CEO and the BAC using a suite of reporting tools. The Internal Audit function has operational independence to carry out its tasks and to report to and advise the Board (via the BAC). To ensure independence, all Group Audit staff globally ultimately report through to the Group Chief Auditor and Group Audit maintains processes and controls to ensure Group Audit staff are independent and objective in all assignments. The Internal Audit Policy provides that if the independence or objectivity of the Internal Audit function is impaired, then details of the impairment must be disclosed to the chairperson of the BAC and will be disclosed in the audit report to the Board. Additionally, the Internal Audit function is quality-reviewed periodically (at least every five years) by an independent qualified body. This review was conducted most recently in 2021 and the results confirmed that Group Auditâs practices conform to IIA standards.",442
207,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"B.6 Actuarial function The ZLAP Head of Actuarial Function (âHoAFâ) is responsible for the Actuarial function and for the tasks carried out by that function under Solvency II and the requirements of the CBIâs Domestic Actuarial Regime in Ireland. All Actuarial function staff report to the HoAF. The high level responsibilities of the Actuarial function are: â Co-ordination and validation of the calculation of Technical Provisions; â Opining on ZLAPâs underwriting policy, the adequacy of its reinsurance arrangements and the companyâs ORSA; â Contributing to the effective implementation of the risk management system; and â Implementing any additional requirements under the CBIâs Domestic Actuarial Regime. As part of its key function role the Actuarial function provides independent and objective assurance to the Board and BRC. To this end the Actuarial function reports to the Board on its activities via a written report submitted at least annually, documenting the tasks performed, identifying any deficiencies where relevant and giving recommendations as to how they should be remedied. The Actuarial function also provides assurance to the BAC in respect of the valuation of ZLAPâs Technical Provisions. B.7 Outsourcing The Company can enter into new outsourcing arrangements where it has identified a material benefit in doing so and will review any proposed new outsourcing arrangements from commercial, regulatory, and customer perspectives. The benefits may include increased efficiencies and reduced costs, reduced risk exposure, and availing of specific expertise or new technology. The Company seeks to ensure that any proposed new or amended outsourcing arrangement is considered in the context of the Boardâs appetite and preference towards operational risk and the potential impact on the quality of service to our customers. The Company has a Board approved outsourcing policy which sets out the risk management principles and requirements for managing outsourcing arrangements. Key principles of the policy are that: â Decisions to outsource are thoroughly reviewed and appropriately approved; â Regulatory requirements, including those relating to critical or important functions or activities are met; and â Capability, risk and control assessments are conducted prior to service commencement and providers are effectively monitored during the life of an arrangement.

During each calendar year, internal reviews are performed that consider the adequacy of individual components of the system of governance. The reviews take account of the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in ZLAPâs business. The reviews are reported to the Board or one of its Committees and typically involve feedback from the relevant management functions (including, where appropriate, the key functions).

Risk Profile Risk Profile Introduction â Risk Strategy and Appetite ZLAPâs risk strategy represents its overall approach to accepting and managing risk. ZLAP targets an appropriate balance of risks in pursuit of its business plan objectives, whilst seeking to reduce or eliminate those risks which do not add value or align to the business plan. As determined by our Risk Appetite Framework, which is aligned to the profile of business that the Company sells as an authorised Life Insurer, ZLAP has a preference for the below risk types. Such risks may be accepted in a controlled fashion as they can be sufficiently rewarded through profit generation or the efficient use of available assets: â Market risk; and â Life insurance underwriting (mortality, morbidity and longevity) risk.",487
209,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Additional risks such as credit, expense, lapse, and operational risks are an unavoidable aspect of the Companyâs business model. ZLAP acknowledges that these risks cannot be eliminated completely in a cost-effective way, but can be tolerated and managed to acceptable levels using ERM techniques. The Risk Appetite Framework provides a boundary to the types and level of risks accepted within ZLAPâs business plan. The Risk Appetite Framework consists of three pillars. The three pillars and how each of them is articulated are set out in the table below. ZLAPâs Risk Appetite Framework Capital & Liquidity Sustainable Earnings Reputation & Sustainability Maintain capital and liquidity levels to meet claims and regulatory / other requirements with a high degree of confidence. Take sufficient (acceptable) risks to achieve target profits and cash generation in a sustainable fashion. Protect reputation and brand through adequate governance and stakeholder consideration. Overview of key risks ZLAP manages a mix of risks typical to a life assurance company in Ireland. Its key risks include underwriting, market, credit (default), and operational risks. The Companyâs approach to managing each of these risks is set out in this section of the report. The Company is also exposed to liquidity risk. While the potential for a liquidity risk event occurring is very low, should an event arise it would have a material impact on the Companyâs operations and its customers. The Companyâs approach to managing liquidity risk has also been set out. The Companyâs approach to managing other material risks, as identified through the Companyâs risk identification and monitoring processes, has also been set out. ZLAPâs Solvency Capital Requirement (âSCRâ) at year end 2021 and 2022 is shown below, split by risk type.

Risk Profile (continued) The table illustrates that the Companyâs regulatory capital requirement has decreased over the year, largely driven by the life underwriting risk capital which is partially offset by an increase in market risk capital. The decrease in life underwriting capital is largely driven by the reduced lapse risk over 2022 due to lower policy values. The increase in market risk is largely driven by the reduction in the coverage level of the management charge derivative programmes over 2022.. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity and FX risk in unit-linked funds because the value of future fund-based fee income (management charges) is proportional to the value of the assets in the funds. ZLAP previously implemented management charge derivative programmes in respect of US equity, European equity and $/â¬ FX exposure which continued into 2022. In 2022 the decision was made to reduce the coverage level of the management charge derivative programmes. This has the impact of increasing the Companyâs risk capital with respect to market risk. C.1 Underwriting risk Underwriting risk is the inherent uncertainty regarding the occurrence, amount or timing of insurance liabilities.",377
211,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Key underwriting risks are described below: â Mortality risk â Where actual claims experience resulting from the death of policyholders is higher than expected; â Longevity risk â Where policyholders, annuitants in particular, live longer than expected; â Morbidity risk â Where actual claims experience resulting from the ill-health of policyholders is higher than expected; â Lapse risk â Where policies are discontinued or contributions are reduced at an unfavourable rate compared to that which is expected; and â Expense risk â Where expenses incurred in acquiring and administering policies are higher than expected, which includes the impact of higher expense inflation relative to expectations. Risk concentrations Concentration risk can arise from a large individual exposure or from an exposure to a group of interconnected insured individuals. Concentration risk, if not managed appropriately, could have the potential to produce losses large enough to threaten the Companyâs business plan and, in severe events, its ongoing capacity to continue its operations. In relation to underwriting risks, concentrations could arise with respect to large aggregated life insurance and critical illness exposures, such as where the Company provides insurance to the employees of a large company, and exposure to individual policyholders with large insurance amounts or benefits. Management of risk concentrations is discussed in the risk mitigation techniques section below. Analysis of underwriting risk sensitivities Given the nature of its business, ZLAPâs solvency position is derived based partly on a number of assumptions related to underwriting risks which reflect both historical experience as well as views on expected future developments. These assumptions reflect the Companyâs best estimate of future claims, lapses and expenses that will arise on existing policies. When assessing its SCR the Company considers quantitatively the impact should future experience deviate materially from the best estimate assumptions. ZLAP also carries out stress and scenario testing as part of the ORSA process (see Section B.3), which includes an assessment of underwriting risks. This enables management and the Board to better understand the Companyâs resilience to adverse outcomes in respect of underwriting risks, both now and into the future, which helps inform business planning as well as other decision-making processes.",456
212,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"A selection of individual stresses in respect of the underwriting risks discussed is set out in the table below, at 31/12/2022: Underwriting Risk Sensitivities Coverage Sensitivity Impact % 5% increase in assured life Mortality 0% 5% increase in pensioner Longevity -1% 5% increase in Morbidity 0% A 10% increase in Lapses +4% A 10% increase in Renewal Expenses -3% A 0.25% increase in Expense Inflation per annum growth rate -1% Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 29 C. Risk Profile (continued) A 10% increase in renewal expenses would cause a 3% reduction in the Companyâs solvency coverage. However, the Company places an emphasis on expense management, enabling this risk to be managed. A 0.25% increase in expense inflation per annum growth rate (relative to expectations) would cause a 1% reduction in the Companyâs solvency coverage. The Companyâs emphasis on expense management also contributes to the management of expense inflation risk. A 10% increase in future expected lapses results in an increase to the solvency coverage. The increase in lapses reduces both the SCR and the Companyâs available assets or Own Funds â as the reduction in the SCR is proportionately more than the reduction in the Own Funds, the overall impact is an increase in the solvency coverage of 4%. ZLAP uses reinsurance to reduce its exposure to adverse trends in longevity, mortality and morbidity. As a result, adverse experience relative to best estimate assumptions does not have a significant impact on the Companyâs solvency coverage position. Given ZLAPâs robust current and best estimate of future solvency coverage levels, adverse changes to future experience at the levels tested by the sensitivities would not represent a material threat to ZLAPâs financial strength. However, the Company continues to monitor these and larger stresses or combinations of stresses through the ORSA and other processes. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the potential for underwriting risks, mortality and morbidity risks in particular, to materialise.",469
213,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"While there has been no significant increase in life or critical illness claims since the emergence of COVID-19, the pandemic has been an example of the uncertainty that is inherent in predicting future claims experience and the importance of the risk mitigation techniques which are described below. The risk of future adverse mortality and morbidity experience impacting the Company, potentially as a result of climate change, was considered in the 2022 ORSA analysis. Risk mitigation techniques Reinsurance is the means by which an insurance company transfers (some or all of) the cost of meeting policyholder claims to a third party (a reinsurance company) in return for an agreed payment. ZLAP has a Board-approved Reinsurance Policy appropriate to the Companyâs overall risk profile which governs its reinsurance arrangements. A high proportion of ZLAPâs mortality, morbidity and longevity risks are transferred to reinsurers. In the event that a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations in relation to the business covered by the reinsurance agreement, ZLAP would still be required to meet the full cost of claims. This is discussed further in Section C.3. In addition, ZLAP applies robust new business underwriting standards which enables the Company to better understand the risks that it is accepting and, in some instances, to decline business where the risks are considered to be unacceptable. ZLAP applies local underwriting and claims policies and procedures that are consistent with the local and Zurich Risk Policy and regulatory requirements. The Company monitors longevity, mortality, and morbidity experience to enable the identification of any emerging trends in a timely manner. Specific measures to manage lapse risk include identifying lapse trends, aligning customer service with customer expectations and structuring contracts in an appropriate manner. Measures to manage expense and expense inflation risk include ongoing monitoring and analysis and seeking appropriate expense efficiencies through process improvements. Concentration risks are managed in line with ZLAPâs Concentration Risk and Underwriting Risk Policies. This includes the use of underwriting limits, catastrophe reinsurance, retention limits per individual life insured (with amounts above these limits being reinsured) and the setting of aggregate Risk Appetite limits at a portfolio level. C.2 Market risk Market risk is the risk of loss associated with assets and liabilities where their value or cash flow depends on financial markets.",465
214,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Key elements of market risk for the Company include: â Equity risk; â Interest rate risk; â Credit spread risk; and â Foreign exchange risk. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 30 C. Risk Profile (continued) Equity risk is the risk of price fluctuations on equity markets affecting the Companyâs earnings, capital, solvency or liquidity position. While ZLAP does hold equities directly, the majority of the Companyâs exposure to equity risk emerges from other sources. ZLAP receives a fee income on unit-linked business which is proportional to the value of the assets under management across its fund range. Therefore, the Companyâs fee income will reduce if the value of the equities in those funds falls. Interest rate risk is the risk of changes in interest rates affecting the Companyâs earnings, capital, solvency or liquidity position. ZLAP is exposed to interest rate risk due to investments, typically bond assets, held in respect of expected future policyholder claims, unit-linked-fund values, employee benefit plans and loans and receivables. The Company engages in an asset-liability matching (âALMâ) process to manage the interest rate risk which arises in respect of future policyholder claims. Credit spread risk is the risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of credit spreads for a constant credit rating and the impact this can have on the value of assets and liabilities (credit migration risk, the risk that a change in a counterpartyâs credit rating may also influence the level or volatility of credit spreads, is an associated risk). ZLAP is exposed to credit spread risk primarily through bond assets held in respect of expected future policyholder claims and employee benefit plans. Foreign exchange risk is the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates affecting the Companyâs earnings, capital, solvency or liquidity position. Similarly to equity risk, ZLAPâs primary currency exposure relates to the loss of fee income from unit-linked funds where policyholder assets are invested in non-Euro denominated assets. Risk concentrations In respect of market risk, concentrations may arise relating to exposures from individual issuers of equities and bonds (both Euro and non-Euro assets) as well as through large exposures to single asset classes or exposures by industrial or geographic sector.",491
215,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Management of concentrations is discussed in the risk mitigation techniques section below. Analysis of market risk sensitivities ZLAPâs profitability and solvency coverage depend on a number of market risk factors. ZLAP carries out stress and scenario testing as part of the ORSA process (see Section B.3) which includes stress testing of market risks such as equity risk and interest rate risk. This enables management and the Board to better understand the Companyâs resilience to adverse outcomes in respect of market risks, both now and into the future, which helps inform business planning as well as other decision-making processes. A selection of individual stresses in respect of the market risks discussed are set out in the table below, at 31/12/2022: Market Risk Sensitivities Coverage Sensitivity Impact % A 0.5% increase in Interest Rates +3% A 0.5% decrease in Interest Rates -3% A 25% increase in Equity Values -7% A 25% decrease in Equity Values +8% A 0.5% increase in Bond Spreads -8% A 0.5% decrease in Bond Spreads +9% A 25% decrease in FX exchange rates +6% Extreme but plausible stress and scenario testing in respect of these risks are considered by the Company through the ORSA and the OSN process when assessing and determining required levels of risk capital. The Company also monitors the outcome of market risk sensitivities on a regular basis. 2022 was characterised by adverse financial market conditions. The global economic environment has featured high levels of volatility and uncertainty driven by a combination of factors including rising inflation and interest rates, concerns around oil and gas supplies caused by the Russia â Ukraine conflict and ongoing issues in global supply chains. Stress and scenario testing exercises enable the Company to understand the potential impacts of a range of market risk events and aiding its readiness to take appropriate steps to protect its capital position and policyholder interests. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 31 C. Risk Profile (continued) Risk mitigation techniques ZLAP manages its market risk through its Investment Strategy and Investment Risk Policy which are both approved by the Board. The ALMIC (see Section B.1) monitors investment risks and adherence to Investment Guidelines which have been designed to manage these risks within acceptable limits.",483
216,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The guidelines are consistent with those detailed in the Zurich Risk Policy and are reviewed on a regular basis. ZLAPâs in-house investment and actuarial teams work together to ensure investment holdings match the underlying policyholder liability profiles. The asset and liability profiles are regularly reviewed, enabling management to take any steps necessary to rebalance the asset profile in a timely manner. ZLAP continues to implement derivative programmes to reduce its exposure to market risk. The Company reduced the coverage of the derivative programmes in 2022, increasing the amount of retained market risk. Another use of derivatives is an embedded interest rate risk hedging programme designed to mitigate the risks associated with contractual benefit options on a block of the Companyâs in-force business, the present value of which is linked to current interest rates. ZLAP invests its assets in accordance with the âPrudent Person Principleâ as set out in Solvency II legislation. Aligned to this principle, ZLAP must only invest in assets and financial instruments whose risks the Company can properly identify, measure, monitor, manage, control and report, and appropriately take into account in the assessment of its OSN. The Company must also ensure that its portfolio of assets is of sufficient quality and security and that the Companyâs liquidity needs have been taken into account as part of the asset selection process. In relation to sustainability risk, ZLAP continues to maintain its key Responsible Investment principles as part of its Environmental Social and Governance (âESGâ) integration strategy across all its investments. This approach is supported by Zurich Groupâs commitment to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. In 2022, the Company advanced a workstream to identify its Article 8 fund offerings, as well as progressing with the development of a Sustainability Framework. Concentration risks are managed in line with ZLAPâs Concentration Risk Policy and Investment Guidelines. Concentration risk management in respect of market risk includes the following: â The ALMIC meets quarterly and monitors investment risks and oversees adherence to Investment Guidelines which have been designed to manage these risks within acceptable limits (these guidelines are monitored by the Companyâs Investment Back Office).",448
217,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The guidelines are consistent with those detailed in the Zurich Risk Policy and are reviewed on a regular basis; â Trading limits and external delegated authorities of individual dealers are agreed by the Chief Investment Officer (âCIOâ) and the Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ); and â Aggregate market risk limits are in place at a portfolio level as part of ZLAPâs Risk Appetite Framework. C.3 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from financial instruments as a result of a counterparty failing to fulfil their financial obligations or where there is an increased likelihood that they will fail to do so in the future. ZLAPâs exposure to credit risk is derived from assets such as bonds, bank holdings and derivatives, as well as with respect to reinsurance. ZLAP has limited credit exposure with respect to operational payments due, such as those from policyholders, intermediaries and other insurance companies. ZLAP does not seek credit risk exposure in the same way as it seeks underwriting and market risk exposure. Credit risk arises out of operational necessity, such as the exposure to banks that hold cash on the Companyâs behalf, or as a result of risk transfer or reduction, such as exposure to reinsurance counterparties following the transfer of underwriting risk. Risk concentrations Concentrations may arise in relation to the types of exposures outlined above. Management of concentrations is discussed in the âRisk mitigation techniquesâ section below. Risk mitigation techniques The Company cannot avoid credit risk due to operational necessity. In some instances the Company accepts and manages credit risk which arises as a result of other risk management practices such as reinsurance. ZLAPâs objective in managing credit risk exposures is to maintain the exposures that arise within parameters that appropriately reflect the Companyâs strategic objectives and Risk Appetite Framework. Sources of credit risk are assessed and monitored, and there are policies to manage the specific risks which arise. To assess counterparty credit risk, ZLAP uses ratings assigned by external rating agencies, qualified third parties such as asset managers, and internal rating assessments. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 32 C. Risk Profile (continued) ZLAP maintains a Concentration Risk Policy as well as other guidelines and exposure limits which sets out the Companyâs standards when considering the associated risks.",495
218,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The following techniques are employed to manage credit risk concentrations across the Company: â Credit risk is monitored by the ALMIC which receives updates on the credit quality of the Companyâs material (non-reinsurance) counterparties; â Strict asset quality and diversification guidelines have been established for counterparties; â The Company engages with a panel of approved reinsurance counterparties and the Reinsurance Policy sets out exposure limits per reinsurer linked to credit rating; â Amounts owed by reinsurers in respect of claims incurred are monitored regularly in line with agreed timelines; â Ring-fenced fund arrangements are in place with the Companyâs custodians to secure its assets in the event that the custodian bank fails; â The Company places cash deposits with a range of banks, limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty; â Collateral arrangements are maintained in respect of certain derivative exposures; and â Credit risk guidelines have been established in line with ZLAPâs Risk Management Policy (supplemented by Zurich Risk Policy) and are managed in close cooperation with Group Investment Management and Group Risk Management. Analysis of credit risk sensitivities While stress and scenario testing is useful in the assessment of credit risk, this risk type can be more appropriately assessed through qualitative analysis of the processes in place to manage this risk. The failure of a highly rated counterparty is considered to be a remote possibility and, as well as this, the interconnectedness of large reinsurance and banking institutions for example, can mean that a potential credit risk event is difficult to predict and assess using quantitative means. Having considered the potential scenarios that may arise and the Companyâs use of highly-rated counterparties, ZLAP is satisfied that the Company has appropriate recovery actions identified which can be implemented should such a scenario arise. C.4 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that ZLAP may not have sufficient liquid financial resources to meet its obligations when they fall due, or would have to incur excessive costs to do so. Liquidity risk could materialise where there is a mismatch in timing or amount between incoming and outgoing cashflows. The Company seeks to minimise liquidity risk and engages in regular monitoring and risk management processes which enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due.",467
219,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Risk concentrations The Companyâs derivative programmes could result in a liquidity demand, therefore the derivative positions are closely monitored and appropriate triggers are in place to ensure timely action is taken. The Company does not have any other material concentrations of liquidity risk. Risk mitigation techniques ZLAPâs Liquidity Policy sets out the framework for managing liquidity risk which includes: â The Company holds the assets underlying its unit-linked liabilities enabling claims on unit-linked polices to be met as they arise; â Where the assets underlying the unit-linked funds are themselves illiquid, policy terms and conditions allow the Company to defer claims for a period while assets are sold to generate cash. This ability to defer claims protects those policyholders who remain invested into the future; â Non-unit liabilities are generally cashflow-matched with highly rated bonds which can be sold quickly to generate cash in most market conditions; and â Assets in excess of those which match policyholder liabilities are mainly invested in liquid, highly rated bonds and deposits with highly rated banks. As well as having risk mitigation techniques in place to manage liquidity risk, the fee income from the existing portfolio of unit-linked funds provides a regular amount of cash to the Company which can be invested in appropriate assets or used to meet cash outflow. Analysis of liquidity risk sensitivities The ALMIC considers the appropriateness of the Companyâs current and projected liquid asset position. To enable the ALMIC to perform this review, the liquidity position is annually projected over the duration of the business plan under a number of credible adverse scenarios. The 2022 exercise viewed the Companyâs capital and liquidity positions as being robust. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 33 C. Risk Profile (continued) In addition to the ALMICâs review, ZLAPâs monthly Liquidity Forum monitors the short term (1 month) and medium term (3 months) liquidity needs of the business. The current liquidity position is also monitored through the Companyâs risk appetite reporting. As with credit risk, the Companyâs exposure to liquidity risk also benefits from qualitative analysis where potential sources of risk are considered. Expected profit included in future premiums Solvency II regulations require the Company to provide the value of its Expected Profit Included in Future Premiums (âEPIFPâ).",487
220,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"The EPIFP reflects the amount of profit that the Company expects to generate from future premiums that are anticipated by the Company. At 31/12/2022, the Companyâs EPIFP was â¬82.3m. C.5 Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of a financial loss or gain, adverse reputational, legal or regulatory impact resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Risk concentrations The potential for concentrations of operational risks arises principally from exposures to key service providers who perform critical or important functions or activities (âCIFAsâ). Key person dependency may also be considered a form of concentration risk. Certain members of staff may be regarded as high value assets and their departure or absence could result in loss of strategic and technical capabilities. As is the case with most financial services companies, the Company is also reliant on IT systems and concentrations may occur as all staff use common IT infrastructure. Risk mitigation techniques The Companyâs control frameworks (as described in Section B.4) are a key component in mitigating operational risks. Guidelines for assessing, mitigating and monitoring operational risk are set out in the Zurich Risk Policy and the Board approved ZLAP Operational Risk Management Policy. Other proactive risk activities include: â Oversight of controls effectiveness in the ORC, RCC, BRC and BAC; â Information security and cyber-security practices and reviews; â Oversight teams monitoring the work of third party service providers; â Monitoring quality and operational performance indicators on a regular basis; â Appropriate research of market conditions and regulatory requirements before launching new products; â Maintaining, testing and reviewing business continuity and disaster recovery plans; â An annual risk-based schedule of internal audits; and â Staff awareness campaigns on matters including business continuity, oversight of third parties, information security and risk management. In particular, with regard to managing concentrations: â The Company manages its third party concentration risks through its Outsourcing Framework as described in Section B.7; and â The Company manages its key person dependency risk through succession planning, individual development plans and annual objective setting for staff, and a comprehensive training framework for all employees. Analysis of operational risk sensitivities Stress and scenario testing is carried out as part of the ORSA process which includes stress testing of operational risks and the potential consequences that may arise as a result.",497
221,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Key areas of operational risk are also assessed qualitatively through the ORSA process. C.6 Other material risks This section summarises the material risks to which the Company is exposed other than those already discussed. These risks have been identified through the Companyâs risk identification and monitoring processes which include activities such as strategic reviews, control environment assessments and emerging risk assessments. Specific processes include the ORSA and the RCSA process which were described in Section B. Strategic risk The Companyâs strategy is defined as the long term plan which enables it to achieve its business objectives. Strategic risk is the risk that unexpected events result in the Companyâs objectives not being achieved or materially delayed or that inappropriate objectives lead to missed business opportunities. Drivers of the risk include: Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 34 C. Risk Profile (continued) â Inadequate assessment of strategic plans; â Ineffective implementation of strategic plans; â Company disruption as a result of transforming the business; â Inadequate resource management; and â Inadequate or inappropriate response to a changing market or regulatory environment. ZLAP has a defined strategy and set of objectives which it is pursuing. While there are risks associated with achieving strategic objectives, having no defined strategy is not a viable alternative. Given the unavoidable nature of risks to the Companyâs strategic objectives, a number of mitigating measures have been put in place. Risk management processes are embedded within the Companyâs strategic development and review processes. As part of regular risk assessment processes, the Board and senior management assess key strategic risks for the Company as a whole, including emerging risks, and their strategic implications. In particular, ZLAPâs annual Total Risk Profile (âTRPâ) exercise is a strategic risk assessment. The TRP guides the identification, measurement and management of risks that threaten the achievement of ZLAPâs strategic objectives. The Company continuously evaluates the sustainability of its strategy over the business planning period. A key objective of the ORSA process is to assess the robustness of the Companyâs strategy in the event that adverse risk events materialise. The ORSA also assesses the appropriateness of the strategy in relation to the Boardâs appetite for risk.",481
222,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Within the ORSA, quantitative scenario and stress testing is carried out to determine the sensitivity of strategic objectives to adverse developments across a range of risks. Qualitative assessments are also used to determine whether other sources of risk, which are less suited to quantitative analysis, may have the potential to adversely impact the Companyâs strategic objectives. Conduct risk Conduct risk is the risk of financial loss or other adverse consequences that arises from conducting business in a way that treats customers unfairly or results in harm to customers. Positive customer-facing conduct is fundamentally linked to the Companyâs strategy and is of particular importance as customers will want to engage with a Company that they trust to provide them or their family with protection over a long period of time. Acts or omissions by ZLAP or any of its employees that are not in the interest of its customer base could damage the Companyâs reputation, and that of the wider Zurich Group, leading to a loss of trust among its customers, existing and potential, as well as other stakeholders. In order to manage its conduct risk, the Company maintains a Conduct Risk Framework which emphasises delivery of fair outcomes that have the interests of customers at heart. The approach ensures that the customer perspective is considered across all areas of the business, both pre-sale and post-sale. The Companyâs Conduct, Regulatory and Compliance Committee deals with, amongst other things, the review and recommendation of the Conduct Risk Framework and quarterly reporting on conduct risk matters. Conduct and related reputational risks are monitored on a regular basis with regular reporting of conduct risk metrics to management and the Board. The Company also monitors external developments in relation to conduct risk which provide insights into the potential for loss associated with poor conduct risk management. Quantitatively, the ORSA also assesses scenarios involving reducing levels of new business and high levels of lapses which could be the result of a reputational risk event. Intra-Group Dependency risk Intra-Group dependency risk is the risk of loss and/or disruption resulting from Zurich Group as a whole or a company within the Group encountering financial difficulties, or from the failure of a Group company to provide key services to ZLAP. The Company may have credit exposures to Group counterparties from time-to-time relating to risk transfer or other financial arrangements. Further, ZLAPâs ability to meet its strategic objectives may be hindered in the event that the Group is experiencing material financial stress.",487
223,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"A number of the outsourced services set out in Section B.7 are provided by companies within the Group. In order to mitigate this risk, ZLAP employs a comprehensive Risk Management Framework which is applicable to overseeing Intra-Group dependency risk in relation to, amongst other matters, project governance, operational resilience, IT risk standards and outsourcing. This oversight is supported by regular risk assessment and a wellembedded control framework. ZLAP monitors the requirements in respect of each critical intra-Group service through a dashboard maintained by the Business Resilience and Outsourcing Oversight Manager. Requirements include appropriate contractual clauses, service level agreements and in-scope services being subject to appropriate business resilience and disaster recovery testing. In relation to financial exposures in particular, the Company also considers intra-Group dependencies through its pre-emptive recovery planning exercise which is carried out at least annually and reviewed by the Board. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 35 C. Risk Profile (continued) ZLAP monitors its exposure to Group counterparties at both an individual and aggregated level. This includes detailed regular monitoring of financial exposures arising from Group entities, while noting the Groupâs strong level of financial resilience (AA rated by Standard and Poors). Monitoring of key risk indicators in relation to service providers enables management to note and take action on any deteriorating trend in service quality. Considering the Companyâs reliance on service providers within the Group as a whole also allows management to assess the overall reliance that the Company places on those providers. Sustainability Risk Sustainability risk is the risk of not achieving sustainability or corporate responsibility objectives. As well as having an impact on macroeconomic factors, sustainability factors could impact the Company and its strategy through regulatory change and/or changing customer behaviours. The Company, and the Group, have already taken steps to manage this risk, particularly in the space of responsible investment management. As an investment manager, the Company is conscious of the need to ensure that it invests policyholder and shareholder funds responsibly. As a global group, Zurich is committed to Responsible Investment and is a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investing. The Group considers that responsible investment is all about âdoing well and doing goodâ. The Company shares this commitment and participates in Group-wide practices in relation to responsible investment. The Zurich Group has made a number of commitments to reduce its carbon footprint over the coming years.",492
224,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"As a signatory of the UN Business Ambition for 1.5Â°C pledge, the Group is committed to using every lever available â investments, operations, and products and services â to accelerate the transition and achieve net-zero emissions across its businesses by 2050. The Company will play an active role in ensuring that it manages its shareholder portfolio in line with Group requirements. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typically either: â Existing risks, whose characteristics have the potential to adversely change unexpectedly and / or with a high degree of uncertainty; or â New risks driven by either internal change in the business or from a range of external factors including macroeconomic, political, social or regulatory. Emerging risks and associated major trends are typically those which could affect the Company over the next five years and beyond. Some emerging risks may take shape more quickly, but their characteristics may still be too uncertain to allow for specific analysis or mitigation at this point in time. If the Company is ill-prepared for changes to the business environment, this may lead to losses or missed opportunities. Current examples of emerging risks relate to customer expectations and digital disruption. To reduce adverse impacts and better anticipate future developments in the business environment, the Company maintains an Emerging Risk Policy. In line with the policy, ZLAP monitors emerging risks through an identification and assessment linked to its TRP and RCSA processes. These are medium/longer term risks, as well as risks that may take shape more quickly but are still too uncertain to allow for specific analysis or mitigation at the point of assessment. Emerging risks, reported through ZLAPâs Emerging Risk Radar and Log, are a standing agenda item on the RCC and BRC agenda. The probability and potential impact of emerging risks can, by the nature of the risk, be difficult to measure in a quantitative manner. The potential impact of emerging risks can be sized in some instances, for example the potential impact of an emerging trend in mortality improvements rates can be determined by applying an extreme but plausible stress to current mortality assumptions. This analysis allows the Company to understand the possible impacts should a severe and adverse trend emerge. Geopolitical risk Geopolitical risk is the risk of loss arising from the political or social policies adopted by governments or other influential groups or as a result of the uncertainty that they create. This risk materialised in 2022, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",487
225,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"From a macroeconomic perspective, the conflict has contributed to high levels of investment market volatility. Similarly to emerging risks, ZLAP monitors the direct and indirect impact that geopolitical risks may have on its operations in order to understand the risks it may face and take appropriate mitigating actions. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 36 C. Risk Profile (continued) The potential impact of geopolitical risks is assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively through stress and scenario analysis. A qualitative assessment will focus on the likely evolution of the risk and how that might impact both the Companyâs operations and its strategic objectives. Again owing to the uncertainty, a quantitative assessment will be guided by the qualitative assessment and may consider a range of outcomes which estimate the potential impact of the particular geopolitical risk. These assessments will focus on the potential impact on financial markets and what change in customer behaviours this might lead to. Staff pension scheme risks ZLAP participates in the Zurich Ireland Staff Pension Scheme alongside other Zurich entities based in Ireland. Elements of the pension scheme carry defined benefit liabilities which guarantee members a minimum benefit amount on retirement. The pension scheme holds a portfolio of assets which are invested to meet the cost of those guarantees. However, if the value of the assets is assessed to be less than the expected cost of the guaranteed benefits this may result in one or both of increased annual contributions from ZLAP or one-off large contributions to reduce the excess of liability cost over asset value. Key risks in respect of the pension scheme are those relating to longevity risk, market exposures (primarily equity and interest rate risk) and credit risk. The level of interest rate risk in respect of the staff pension scheme continues to be carefully monitored. The Company takes a number of measures to mitigate the potential risk of increased Zurich Ireland Staff Pension Scheme costs. The pension scheme is managed by pension trustees, in accordance with the trust deed. In line with local market practices, the scheme is treated as a ring-fenced fund for regulatory solvency calculation purposes. Any pension scheme deficit, calculated on an IAS19 basis, is also recognised as a Company liability in regulatory solvency capital calculations. In addition, the Zurich Ireland Staff Pension Scheme maintains a register of scheme risks which are considered by trustees on a quarterly basis. The trustees review risk ratings and consider mitigating actions as appropriate. If necessary, the trustees will submit proposals to ZLAP management for their decision.",497

This analysis provides the Company with insights into the sources of risk associated with the pension scheme and the potential impacts. Information security risk A specific type of operational sub-risk exists with respect to cyber attacks and the protection of customer data. Cyber risk relates to the possibility of unauthorised access or disclosure of customer data and disruption or financial / reputational loss arising from vulnerabilities being exploited in ZLAPâs control environment around interconnected IT systems. Cyber risk can arise from a variety of sources and the risk may be heightened as IT systems age. The Company operates strong preventative and detective controls around monitoring and remediation of cyber threats through the activities of its Information Security function, with regular reporting to the BRC, RCC and ORC. ZLAPâs IT department maintains an information security dashboard which is presented at the quarterly risk committees. Periodic risk assessments in respect of information security risks are also undertaken. In managing its exposure to cyber risk, ZLAP also leverages expertise within the Group such as the Cyber Fusion Centre and participates in Group initiatives aimed at coordinating and strengthening the management of this risk. Digitalisation is a key enabler of the Companyâs strategy and a strong digital offering is important in appealing to customers and brokers. There is a risk that the Company fails to adequately enhance its digital capacity, with potential consequences including an increase in complaints, breaches and an adverse impact on the customer experience. The Company has implemented a range of mitigating actions to prevent this risk from materialising. Business resilience risk Business resilience risk is the risk associated with the ability to withstand or recover on a timely basis from disruptive events. The Company recognises the operational and reputational risks associated with the materialisation of such a failure or disruption. The Company is developing an Operational Resilience Framework which will improve its posture in this area, with a number of milestones planned for 2023. The Company will continue to monitor the development of geopolitical risks such as the ongoing energy crisis as a result of the Russia â Ukraine conflict, which could potentially have an impact on the Companyâs operational resilience.

The technical provisions for ZLAPâs unit reserve qualifies to be calculated as a whole (calculated by multiplying units held by valuation price). The value of these liabilities is based on the market price of the underlying financial instruments.

234,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Under this approach, the BEL is derived by: â Projecting the expected (non-unit related) liability cash-flows for each future year using best-estimate deterministic assumptions; â Discounting each of these cash-flows back to the valuation date using the relevant Solvency II risk-free rate of return; and â Summing the resultant discounted cash-flows. The value of options and guarantees attached to Unitised With-Profits business is calculated using a stochastic approach, based on 1,000 economic scenarios. Within this stochastic model, the economic simulations are generated from a market-consistent risk-neutral model and the best estimate non-economic assumptions are applied deterministically. Under this approach, the BEL is derived by: â Projecting the liability cash-flows arising within the unitised with-profits fund using realistic deterministic noneconomic assumptions for each year in the future under a wide range of market consistent economic scenarios; Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 41 D. Valuation for Solvency Purposes (continued) â Discounting each of these cash-flows back to the valuation date to determine the liability value across all simulations; and then â Taking the average across all of the stochastic scenarios. Risk Margin methodology: The Risk Margin is calculated as per the prescribed Solvency II cost-of-capital approach. This requires the SCR to be calculated for each year in the future. ZLAPâs approach to projecting the SCR is to use appropriate risk factors in order to project the individual components of the SCR. These risk factors are taken from ZLAPâs financial projection model which projects cash-flows using best-estimate assumptions. Any hedgeable market or counterparty risk is excluded from the SCR projections. Assumptions The assumptions used in the calculation of the Technical Provisions can be classified into three distinct groups: demographic, economic and future management actions. The demographic assumptions used in all financial reporting measures, including the calculation of Technical Provisions, are reviewed annually by the Actuarial Function and submitted to the Board for approval. In cases where ZLAP has sufficient experience data to produce a credible basis, the standard approach is to use actual experience to set assumptions. In cases where ZLAP does not yet have sufficient experience data to derive a credible basis, the approach will necessarily vary with the nature of the assumption being set.",495
235,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"In such cases, ZLAPâs own experience data may be supplemented by any or all of the following: â Industry experience studies and standard table publications; â Data sourced from reinsurance providers; and â Experience and industry knowledge from other areas of the Zurich Group. The annual review of assumptions took place in Q3 2022. Mortality, morbidity, longevity and persistency assumptions were updated as part of this review. Economic assumptions are updated at each quarterly reporting period. Expense unit costs are reviewed in detail once per annum and are increased in line with expense inflation on a quarterly basis. The main economic assumptions relevant for the calculation of ZLAPâs Technical Provisions are: 1. Term Structure of Risk-Free Interest Rates â This is provided by EIOPA (the EIOPA Risk-Free Swap Curve). 2. Expense unit costs â The unit costs are based on a set of best estimate expenses for the next calendar year and adjusted for any expenses which are not expected to recur in the long term. The investigation also provides a split of expenses between initial and renewal, and between direct and overhead. 3. Expense inflation â This is determined quarterly by using market observable data on inflation. Under the Solvency II regime, companies are permitted to include the impact of future management actions in the calculation of the Technical Provisions provided these assumptions meet the criteria set out in Article 23 of the Solvency II Delegated Acts. Management actions are subject to annual approval by the Board. Indication of the level of uncertainty The Technical Provisions are calculated within controlled systems and subject to multiple reviews to ensure they are accurate. Procedures and processes are in place to identify any potential issues or errors in the calculation. One example of estimates in the Technical Provisions is the set of assumptions underlying the calculation of the Technical Provisions outlined above. These assumptions are reviewed annually and are subject to several review points before approval by the Board. An exercise to analyse the expected sensitivity of the Technical Provisions to changes in various assumptions is also performed and ensures that the impact of changes is well understood.

There is no Risk Margin requirement in the liabilities in the financial statements. Unit Linked and Insurance with Profit Participation Policies Under Solvency II, the discounted value of all future cash flows (within the contract boundary) is included.

In making this assessment the Directors have considered the following: a) the Companyâs capital position and the surplus over its required solvency capital ratio and minimum capital ratio; b) the resilience of the Companyâs solvency surplus; c) the Companyâs level of reinsurance; d) the Companyâs business plan; e) impact and uncertainty from COVID-19; f) the Companyâs liquidity position; g) the impact of the transfer of the Companyâs Italian based policies to Zurich Investments Life S.p.A (âZILâ). On that basis, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the SFCR on a going concern basis. As such the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. No additional material information on the valuation of assets and liabilities has been identified. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 46 E. Capital Management E.1 Own funds Objectives of Capital Management Own Funds refers to the available financial resources, or excess of assets over liabilities in the Solvency II Balance Sheet. Under the Solvency II regime, the CBI requires ZLAP to hold Own Funds in excess of 100% of the SCR. For ZLAP, the SCR is calculated in accordance with the Solvency II Standard Formula. The SCR is based on a mixture of formula driven calculations and stress tests calibrated to a 1 in 200 year probability level. In the event that the level of Own Funds is less than 100% of SCR (or trending towards that level in the next three months) then the ZLAP Board must approve a remediation plan for submission to the CBI, within two months of the date of the breach.",480
242,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Also calculated under Solvency II is the Minimum Capital Requirement (âMCRâ). This is a lower benchmark than the SCR. In the event that Own Funds is less than the MCR it is likely that the CBI would then intervene in the running of the Company. The Company maintains an efficient capital structure consistent with the regulatory and market requirements of its business. The objective of Own Funds management is to maintain, at all times, sufficient Own Funds to cover the SCR and MCR with an appropriate buffer. The Companyâs approach to developing the Business Plan is focussed on understanding the best-estimate of profit expected to emerge in each of the following 3 years. Structure of the Own Funds The table below shows the structure of the Solvency II Own Funds at 31/12/2022 and 31/12/2021. Structure of the Own Funds in EUR millions, as of 31 December 2022 Ordinary share capital (gross of own shares) 17.7 17.7 341.2 341.2 Share premium account related to ordinary share capital 2021 Reconciliation reserve 589.2 568.0 Total Own Funds 948.1 926.8 There have been no changes to the ordinary share capital or share premium account during 2022. The ordinary share capital and share premium arising is not subordinated and has no restricted duration. The reconciliation reserve equals the excess of assets over liabilities less other basic Own Fund items, as at the reporting date. This reconciliation reserve mainly consists of the expected future profits included in the Technical Provisions and any past profits that have not been transferred as dividends to Zurich Insurance Group. The reconciliation reserve therefore can be sensitive to experience variances and will be subject to the risk sensitivities discussed in Section C. The reconciliation reserve has increased by â¬21m in 2022. The increase is mainly due to the emergence of profits on existing business, offset by the impact of negative economic conditions on expected future profits. The Companyâs ordinary share capital, share premium arising on ordinary share capital and reconciliation reserve are all available as tier 1 unrestricted Own Funds as per Article 69 (a) of the Delegated Regulation.",456

Financial Statements Equity is calculated in line with FRS 101. The main items giving rise to the difference between the financial statements Equity and Solvency II Own Funds are: â Reserving: Financial statement reserve calculations include some allowance for prudence. Under Solvency II, the Technical Provisions include the discounted value of all future cash flows within the contract boundaries. Solvency II Technical Provisions include a Risk Margin. The main reserving differences are discussed further in Section D.2. â Reinsurance: This is due to the reserving differences and is discussed in Section D.1. â Tax: Tax assets and liabilities under each measure reflect the timing of the recognition of profits and will therefore necessarily differ due to the other items listed here.",477
245,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"â Deferrals of Acquisition Income and Expenses: Methodology for the financial statements requires upfront costs and fees to be recognised over the lifetime of the policy which results in the creation of assets in respect of deferred acquisition and origination costs and a liability in respect of deferred origination fees. Solvency II methodology recognises these costs and fees as they are incurred. â Other Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are a financial statements accounting concept. They can be recognised under Solvency II only when they can be sold separately and a valuation can be derived from a quoted market price, in an active market, for the same or a similar intangible asset. Deferred Tax Assets The company has no deferred tax asset on the Solvency II balance sheet as at 31/12/2022, and therefore no net deferred tax assets are available as basic own-fund items classified as Tier 3 in accordance with Article 7 six 6(a)(iii). Further analysis of own funds None of the Companyâs Own Funds are subject to transitional arrangements and the Company has no ancillary Own Funds. No deductions are applied to Own Funds and there are no material restrictions affecting their availability and transferability. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 48 E.

The main movements in the SCR are due to: â The negative investment market growth in 2022 decreased ZLAPâs expected future profits on unit linked business. This is the main driver of the decrease in Life Underwriting Risk. â ZLAPâs existing derivative programs were reduced to recapture equity and currency risk exposure in 2022. This is the main driver of the increase in Market Risk.",487
247,SFCR-Zurich-Life-Assurance-plc-2022.txt,"Loss absorbing capacity of deferred tax The Loss Absorbing Capacity of Deferred Taxes (âLACDTâ) is equal to the change in value of deferred taxes that would result from a loss equal to the Basic SCR plus Operational Risk. ZLAP has a Solvency II Deferred Tax Policy which outlines the methods and assumptions for LACDT in the SCR Calculation. ZLAPâs approach is to limit the LACDT to the base Deferred Tax Liability in the Solvency II Balance Sheet. The LACDT increased solvency coverage by 2.02% at 31/12/2022. Within the LACDT, ZLAP do not attempt to justify transiting to a Deferred Tax Asset which would only have value if sufficient future profits emerged after suffering the instantaneous stress. Zurich Life Assurance plc Solvency and Financial Condition Report 2022 49 E.
